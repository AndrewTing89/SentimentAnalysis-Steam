The visual quality is top-tier – environments are richly detailed, and I have to give special praise to the dungeon design. The atmosphere, lighting, and visual storytelling in those areas truly blew me away while exploring the game for the first time. It felt like there was something magical here – something worth investing time in.\n\nAnd yet, as I reached the later stages of the game, that initial wonder began to fade. What replaced it was something much less enchanting: a system built around grind, RNG, and what feels like a casino-inspired loot loop.\n\nInventory Hell\nLet’s start with the biggest flaw: the inventory system. It's a mess. You spend an absurd amount of time just sorting through endless piles of junk – useless armor, weapons, and trinkets that serve no purpose. There's no satisfying way to sell or discard them. It’s not just clutter; it actively kills momentum and enjoyment. In WoW, even bad loot had a reason to exist. Here, it’s just digital garbage.\n\nCombat and Progression\nThe combat is actually good – smooth, responsive, and enjoyable. But the progression is bizarrely lopsided. Leveling is way too fast and easy, while gathering professions like mining become a painful, drawn-out grind. It feels like two separate games – one rushing you forward, the other dragging you back.\n\nDisconnected World, Shallow Exploration\nDespite the beautiful locations, the world feels oddly disconnected. There's no meaningful interaction with the environment, no real sense of presence. You don’t need to explore, and once you've seen an area, there’s little reason to return. The world is too small, too static. New zones should be arriving yearly, along with a steady flow of new dungeons and raids – not just recycled ones with increased difficulty.\n\nFrom Immersion to Slot Machines\nThis is where the real disappointment hits. The game slowly shifts from immersive MMO to something that feels designed around loot crate addiction. The gameplay ends up revolving around opening boxes, hoping for a lucky drop – like a slot machine in a 24/7 convenience store. That kind of design breaks the fantasy, breaks the immersion, and ultimately breaks the game.\n\nEconomy in Chaos\nThe auction house is another weak link. Because of the nonsensical item system, prices are wildly inconsistent. It’s difficult to judge value, and trading becomes more frustrating than rewarding. It’s a symptom of the game’s deeper design issues.\n\nBright Spots Still Exist\nTo be fair, there are elements worth celebrating. The voice-acted NPC dialogue during story quests is a huge plus. Hearing characters speak adds a layer of immersion and personality that plain text just can’t deliver – and it genuinely made me care more about the main story, at least at first. More MMOs should do this.\n\nWorld bosses and live events also shine – for brief moments, you feel part of a living, breathing community. And the musical instruments and group performances? Pure genius. These systems are fun, original, and show a glimpse of the game’s untapped potential.\n\nConclusion: A Lost Opportunity\nThis game could have been one of the greats. It had the budget, the engine, the setting. For a while, it looked like it might truly rival the giants of the genre. But over time, poor design choices, inventory frustration, and a shift toward “casino-style” systems have dragged it down.\n\nIt’s beautiful, but broken.

I've noticed alot of times lately games become 'popular to hate' when they have a launch that is flawed in any way, or even just not the end-all-be-all game to spend every future waking second playing for them personally, they start or create some kind of hate train.\n\nAs a traditional fantasy MMORPG format, this is one of the newest and by far the best iterations of that genre. This game has one of the best combat systems ever put in an MMORPG, BY FAR. With active, split second dodging, real hit-boxes where you can jump over and duck under projectiles and swings actually miss if they don't physically touch you. I believe there are character collisions as well, IIRC. All projectiles have to actually be aimed, which adds a HUGELY immersive element to large raids or the fortress defense activity things. For instance, as an archer, you are actually aiming the arrows slightly upward to compensate for gravity's pull, so the arrows fall into the mob of melee fighting going on ahead of you between the enemy NPC melee and your own RAID group. Combat is fast paced, and positioning matters greatly, ESPECIALLY when using a weapon like rapier. Every fraction of a second matters because some of your abilities effectively teleport behind the enemy, but doesn't stun for like 3 seconds like in WOW. You are just using your abilities and positioning to actually physically dodge the enemies attacks. Not getting hit no matter what, and hoping it rolls well, again, like in traditional MMORPGs. The combat in this is much faster paced and way more movement, positioning, and timing involved because you actually have to 'HIT' the enemy, and they you.\n\nThe class system is great; you can effectively level every class on one character if you choose, and the same goes for crafting/skills type leveling. \n\nThe music system is bar-none the absolute best. The game practically has Guitar Hero (without the guitar controls, so step mania?) or Rockband just built into the game as a skill to level and progress. And you can do it with your other party members or whomever, and each person plays a different instrument and part of the song.. for like 100s of songs, IIRC.\n\nThe builds system is unique and very customizable. Each weapon has a major and minor stat that contributes to it. And you can equip two weapon types to switch between. So, I.E. speccing with high dexterity helps you as a 'major' stat for both bow and spear. But, it also helps by contributing half points to things like Hatchet and Two handed sword as a 'Minor' stat. combine this with magic type weapons, and a talent tree style system, and you get the picture. \n\nSorry if some of it is vague, a lot is coming from memory. But I am actually reinstalling the game right now.\n\nOne tip: Check the server populations online before you make your character. Currently, in the US, Us West servers are virtually empty compared to the healthy population on Us East. XD\n\nAnyways, if you're looking for a traditional(ish) fantasy MMORPG with great combat and leveling and skills system....

You feel strong with good gear and eventually as you level you start weakening out and need to get new stuff which feels balanced and fair. \r\n3. The zones blend pretty smooth and there's more variety of mobs compared to New World when it was released.\r\n4. The faction system really encourages you to get into pvp BUT it doesn't feel shoved down your throat\r\n5. Buy it once, no monthly sub, no P2W that I've noticed\r\n\r\nBad---\r\n1. Sometimes there's some (minor) connectivity issues.\r\n2. Every time I see someone on a mount I get miffed that in order to ride one (something every other MMO has base game) I need to pay another $30 for\r\n3. While the game is a buy once, play forever style it's frustrating that for things like transmog and other basic stuff they charge for it. The main problem here I think is it costs way too much for something like that. I want my character to look cool but damn if it's going to cost that much I'd rather pay a sub and have it thrown in for free.\r\n4.

Um bilionário colocou uma bolsa de dinheiro infinito no colo de incompetentes e deixou eles gerindo um mmo sem supervisão.\n\nNão recomendo.\n- Balanceamento porco e preguiçoso.\n\n- Pay2Win: ou você paga pra avançar de forma ainda insatisfatória, ou vai ralar mais que um clt em 6x1 para conseguir equipamentos medíocres.\n\n- Reworks e adições horríveis: mudam totalmente o funcionamento de mecânicas (atributos, perks, etc), do nada, inutilizando completamente sets que você ficou 6 ou mais meses para conseguir deixar minimamente usável.\n\n- Falta de transparência: não avisam de atualizações e nem compartilham os planos, só surgem igual o mestre dos magos, soltam uma bomba inútil e somem. \n\n- Poucos jogadores: maioria já pulou fora, só ficou quem tem algum transtorno psiquiátrico grave. Maioria dos servidores estão inóspitos, e a gerencia faz questão de tomar escolhas para dividir ainda mais a player base que sobrou. Já é praticamente um jogo singleplayer de mundo aberto. Com o aumento de preço ridículo que eles fazem a cada ano não espere novos jogadores.\n\n- Muito repetitivo: como se já não bastasse poucos jogadores, resultando em tempos de espera gigantes para fechar um time pra uma dungeon ou expedição, a quantidade absurda de vezes que você tem que repetir alguma coisa para avançar (dungeon, coleta, etc) destrói toda a vontade de jogar. É sempre a mesma coisa, nada muda, não tem nada procedural, nenhum incentivo.\n\n- Muitos bots: por ser sempre a mesma coisa, muitos dos jogadores que vc encontrar fazendo algo, na real são bots programados para ficar repetindo ações, e consequentemente te atrapalhando.\n\n- Sistema de report é um lixo: é cheio de hacker e bots, mas os únicos que são banidos serão aqueles que as panelinhas e os streamers fizerem report bomb, ou seja, só é banido aqueles que eles não forem com a cara e que jogam na moralzinha, os hackers e bots saem impunes na maioria das vezes.\n\n- Mal otimizado: roda mal até em maquina high end.\n\n- Cheio de bugs: como se ja não bastasse a otimização horrível sem motivo algum, ainda tem bugs, glitches e exploits à rodo. É tão bizarro, que tinha* comunidades em diversos locais (discord, reddit, telegram, e outros fóruns) que eram* dedicadas a explorar essas falhas pra tirar vantagem e fazer graça. *No passado, pois se restou 1 ou 2 comunidades ativas de algo sobre New World é muita coisa já. Fora os bugs ocasionais que atrapalham sua gameplay, são muitos, e quando corrigem 1 aparecem outros 2.\n\n- Muito caro: paguei uns 50 conto na época, e o jogo sempre foi porco com administração duvidosa, pelo menos tinha muitos jogadores, ainda era um mmo [multiplayer **massivo** online] apesar dos muitos problemas. Hoje ta só o caco, ou nem isso, ta só o pó do caco. Quem pagar o preço atual, ou mais de 100 reais nessa porcaria que seja, pode pegar seu troféu de otário. No valor de 50 ja tava ruim, e agora parece que piorou.\n\n\nNão tem nem motivo pra esse jogo continuar no ar. Já podem fechar e demitir todo mundo.

Not a big fan of their focus on pumping out boring dungeons, or the PvE in OPR, their Junkyard engine, all the bugs, the massive amount of gold going to territory company owners (although the horizontal gear progression made this less of an issue), and imbalance with bows/muskets. There's a large focus on PvE when it's not that great; very little focus on open world PvP, wars, 3v3s, and OPR which is where this game shines. Devs seem to listen to their players but the shift in focus away from NW at AGS hurt the PC playerbase (especially after the Aeternum console update). Also I think the corruption portals should be more similar to those seen in the game Oblivion! Stopped playing after the game rename patch. Mainly played BB/FS, BB/Hatchet, GS/Hatchet.

Needs more variety when it comes to combat and content.\r\n\r\nStory is decent, although has a few dips here and there (IMO first big bad introduction as corrupting cunning force was pretty weak, she seemed like a 100% villain with taunts rather than making valid points). Sidequests range from normal to a bit weird, but almost all are voiced. They do lack variety though, there aren't really any proper puzzles or custom mechanics tied to quests like in some other MMOs.\r\n\r\nThe world is pretty but looting broken houses for absolutely the same materials gets quite repetitive very fast. The game really would benefits from metas and dynamic world events that some other MMOs have.\r\n\r\nCombat is a mixed experience. From one point of view it's very responsive. From another it's just switching between 2 weapons with 3 active skills of out 6 toal + very minor skill customization. Oh and also +1 skill from heartrune. It lacks depth, variety. Feels spammy and by the time I reached Elysian Wilds I got bored with it, even though I started switching ranged weapon between bow and firestaff.\r\nOn top of that DPS builds are too squishy. It's not fun when enemy sneezes at you and you lose 50% hp or straight up get oneshot.\r\nBlocking is very hard because of visual spam, it's just impossible to see when enemies attack. And there is no option to turn down/hide ally skill effects, so if you're part of 20-man raid, the screen is a multicolored vomit.\r\n\r\nI didn't quite get into endgame content aside from trying some open world elite chest runs and M1 expeditions, but it seems that endgame is mostly raid and mutated expedition grind. There aren't many mutated expeditions and once again they get repetitive fast, while giving barely any useful rewards.\r\n\r\nGearing could be done better. You loot various named upgradeable gear pieces with 600+ GS but in reality when it comes to PvE gear, everyone is running the same 3 perks, because they're strictly better for survivability.

Unfortunately like most developers they promise gold and give you turd. \n\nThe foundation of the game was promising, the world looked stunning, the quests where okay to grind, the grind wasn't to quick or to long, the classes, weapons, and armour where good but it quickly shown you had no idea what you was doing . \n\nThe first problem was not enough worlds on servers. You had friend groups who were on all different worlds and servers because they was that full they couldn't get in together. They promised that once more worlds were available you could switch worlds and SERVERS to join friends and told us to keep grinding . We had a friend group of about ten that was all split up and I think half left the game soon as it was announced we couldn't change to be with our friends . \n\nThe ones who kept playing enjoyed the game (despite some of us having to start back at level 0) all the way up to the point of end game. Full story and quests done. The raids were fun but only so much you can do over and over again . \n\nThe main problem was the PVP. Iv always said that for a game to survive long term there has to be a good and fair PvP system for all players, once the main PvE story is done and completed hundreds of raids what then? It's check out PvP or go play a different game.\n\nNow the PvP combat was fun and so was the PvP events but the problem they had was the Territory wars for settlements.\nNow settlements gave clans massive bonuses and incomes of gold if they held them so was really important but only the biggest and top clans could compete for these settlements leaving smaller clans having no look in. So the only option to be apart of these wars was to join a big clan right? Wrong, even if you join a clan the leader selects who he wants to fight in the wars so you never get a look in because he picks all his mates and sweats. \n\nWhy not make smaller settlements to be took over that can only be took over by clans with 10 or less people ? Or 20 ? Everyone can have a good PvP experience and enjoy the wars", "timestamp_created": 1749485803, "timestamp_updated": 1749485803, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Je pense juste ça dépend de votre profil de gamer et de MMO RPG.\r\n\r\nProfil MMO : \r\no Casual player (Je n'accroche pas à WoW ou à Lost Ark)\r\no Full PvE (JcE) (Je n'aime pas le PvP)\r\n\r\nPoints positifs :\r\no Les graphismes sont vraiment très bons pour un mmo rpg. Je l'ai notamment comparé à TESO qui pour moi est nettement plus vieux par rapport à NW. Pour WoW la DA est tellement particulière que c'est pas comparable.\r\no Le système de quête et de leveling sont vraiment bien adapté pour les profils casuals comme moi. On peut atteindre le level max (65) sans groupe, tout peut être fait en solo, même si certains bosses sont compliqués.\r\no Le stuffing en terme de scaling est bon aussi. On reçoit des items qui nous permettent largement de matcher les dégâts des monstres lorsqu'on évolue de zone au cours de la quête principale.\r\no Le système d'arme est vraiment stylé. Pas de classe, que des armes qui donnent des compétences et qui permettent d'adopter un style différent d'une arme à une autre sans changer de personnage, ce qui est très agréable.\r\n\r\nPoints neutres :\r\no Les métiers sont biens pensés, mais le leveling pour certains est tellement long et lent que lorsqu'on passe à côté de certaines ressources et qu'on ne peut pas les prendre, c'est frustrant mais je trouve que pour le endgame c'est cool.\r\no Les quêtes annexes sont biens mais sur le début de jeu, ça n'exp rien par rapport à la quête principale ce qui est dommage pour les gens qui aiment faire les quêtes annexes avant la principale. Le ration : bénéfice/temps investi n'est pas rentable sur l'early et c'est dommage\r\n\r\nPoint négatifs :\r\no Le fait d'acheter le jeu à 60€, je trouve qu'il les vaut, cependant, les micro-transactions pour les cosmétiques et surtout pour les jetons transmog pour avoir l'apparence d'équipement... Bon ça c'est pas ouf. Si vous voulez avoir un beau perso harmonieux, faut compter rajouter 50-60€ facile.\r\no L'après-leveling 65 : La transition est pas très fluide parce qu'il n'y a pas de point de repère pour optimiser son stuffing ou de te faire comprendre où aller pour t'optimiser et devenir meilleur pour peut être passer sur du JcJ ou du contenu very endgame qui requière de l'optimisation maximal.\r\no  Les expéditions (Les donjons) : Je suis sur le monde Ariès et pour trouver une expédition facilement en normal, il faut vraiment se lever tôt. Le jeu n'est pas mort, mais compliqué de trouver si vous n'êtes pas dans une faction ou une \"guilde\"/communauté.\r\no Certains bugs un peu relou comme l'apparition de mobs sans barre de vie (donc immortel) qui te lache des moins 500 au level 35, pas ouf ouf.\r\n\r\nConclusion :\r\nLe jeu est cool et je pense vraiment que c'est un très bon jeu. J'ai fait 42h de jeu en 5 jours, ce qui est vraiment pas mal, j'y ai accroché au vu de mon profil de joueur de MMO RPG. Je pense que si vous êtes un hardcore des MMO type Wow, etc. et un gros gros consommateur de contenu very endgame PvE, je ne sais pas si ce jeu s'adresse à vous. Mais si vous êtes comme moi un casu qui aime bien jouer de manière chill et juste passer du bon temps en jouant, le jeu est à mon sens adressé pour vous.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1749375975, "timestamp_updated": 1749375975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

If this game is the future of gaming, then grab your loincloth and stone tools, because we’re going back to the Dark Ages. Not the fun, sword-swinging Dark Ages the ones with lice, mud, and dysentery.\n\nThis game is less “New World” and more like “Expired Product Left in Bezos’ Garage Since 2018.” You log in, greeted by a loading screen (on my new killer rig with suck yo dack nvmes and shit) that lasts longer than Amazon’s commitment to workers’ rights, and enter a world where every single player is either a tree-chopping automaton or a shirtless gremlin spawn-camping a wolf den for crafting mats. You’re not building a fantasy empire you’re doing unpaid labor in a digital Amazon warehouse.\n\nFighting is is a mix of circle jerk and pray with all the satisfying impact of hitting a wiffle ball with a wet sock. Somehow, despite this being 2025, swordfighting feels like two mannequins slap-fighting  in a 2004 Dr. Who episode.   PVP boils down to what I call... the dance.   Moving on.\nThe story, which is like someone asked ChatGPT to write a fantasy plot but trained it exclusively on Amazon Prime TV scripts. You’ve got your usual “ancient evil,” “corrupted magic,” and “you are the chosen one” tropes, but written with all the depth of a Jeff Bezos LinkedIn post. The voice acting is a buffet of accents nobody asked for. One guy sounds like a Narubian pirate that has never seen the ocean, another like he’s doing a low-budget Bridgerton audition on syrup. I half-expected someone to say, “By the light of the Amazon Algorithm, Bezo's protects!”\n\nOh yeah the algorithms, i mean... auction house.  The game’s economy is a lawless stock market simulator run by dupe fiends who majored in meme coins. Inflation runs wild. A stick costs more than your first car. Gold farming is more lucrative than your actual job. Crafting is a Kafkaesque nightmare requiring 900 bear pelts, three star-metal penile implants, and the blood of Bezos himself to make a Level 3 chair.\n\nThe true glory here though, what really makes New World special is its glorious commitment to soulless bloat. Everything takes forever. Walk for 15 minutes, fight a boar, get 2 XP, repeat until you are dead inside.

Each biome is unique in quests, animals, enemies, houses, people and the culture. For Example, Brimstone sands is a massive desert territory with scorpions, coyotes, lions, ect. The Brimstone quests all focus on Ancient Egyptian and Roman mythology and lore. If youre not interested in that, here are some other long questlines built around other mythologies and legends; \nGreek Mythology: Greek mythology can be found within the game's lore. including a boss fight with Medusa.\nViking/Norse Mythology: There are Norsemen characters, such as the Rus' Varangians led by Warlord Varik, who play a role in the island's story, connecting to legendary figures.\nArthurian Legends: King Artorius (King Arthur) and the Knights of the Round Table are featured in the lore, adding elements of British and Arthurian mythology. The amount of effort put into making each region feel unique makes this a game you could easily spend hundreds of hours in without even touching PvP or grinding.\n\n{2} Combat in New World: Aeternum is one of the best in the MMO genre. It's fluid, responsive, and actually skill-based a huge breath of fresh air compared to the usual tab-targeting systems in other MMOs. You have to dodge, aim, block, and time your attacks, which gives every fight a more action RPG feel. Whether you’re swinging a greatsword, firing a musket, or casting void magic, every weapon feels weighty and distinct. It feels like playing an action RPG in a MMORPG setting. There is also a lot of variety with the weapon choices and skills so you can play any way you want. \n\n{3} PVE PVE PVE PVE I lowkey hated pvp in any MMO before new world and other MMOs put more effort into PVP then unique enemies. enemies in Mew World behave differently depending on faction undead enemies fight very differently than corrupted knights or ancient constructs. Boss fights often require real strategy and positioning, especially in expeditions (dungeons) or elite zones. And in PvP? The combat system makes 1v1s and group battles feel intense, fast-paced, and fair (as long as your build isn’t completely busted, anyway) but PVP is fun asf and not forced theres a Free For All zone with dabloons you collect if you die you lose them, if you get out you keep them. FFA is fun, Outpost Rush is super fun and they added a new map for it. PVE content is amazing theres tons of expeditions, dungeons, elite raids Weekly invasions which are fucking amazing 20 people in a discord VC with someone giving everyone directions on where to go. there is a daily refresh for soul trials so you can do daily solo boss fights for unique rewards. and WEEKLY rotation for Mutated dungeons, and massive world events like Myrk, Siren, Well, and World Tours. \n\n\n{4}The trade skills in New World: Aeternum are a full game on their own. This isn’t your typical MMO crafting where you just click “craft” and walk away. Every profession from gathering to refining to crafting has real depth and impact on your character and the game world. There are 17 different trade skills split across gathering, refining, and crafting, and each one has its own leveling path, perks, and unique gameplay loops.\nGathering includes mining, logging, harvesting, skinning, and fishing. Each resource node is placed in the open world, and they don’t just sit in plain sight.\nRefining lets you process those raw materials into usable components like turning iron into steel or rawhide into rugged leather. These aren’t throwaway skills either; mastering refining improves efficiency and quality, unlocking rare materials and bonuses.\nCrafting is where it all comes together. Whether you're making gear (weapons, armor), consumables (potions, food), or furniture for housing, crafting in New World feels rewarding. There’s a ton of customization, with stats, perks, and even luck modifiers influencing the quality of what you make.\nThere is also a skill called Music which is what made me get the game originally. Many different instruments to play and tons of songs to play that give buffs to your group. Player Economy, Goated Af this one goes hand in hand with trade skills, anything you craft or even powerful loot you find in a dungeon can be sold on the market or traded between players for Gold or Other items, makes the world feel soooo alive and I truly love this feature.\n\n{5} Fashion in this game is great there is an amazing transmog system and Ive spent hours making new outfits. Any armor you pick up saves that style as a transmogable piece to any armor youre wearing, are you wearing light armor but wanna look like youre in full plate armor to bamboozle players in PvP? easy and you can get transmog tokens in the battle pass or just buy them. \n\nTheres much more I could say but I'll leave it at this; There’s much more I could say, but I’ll leave it at this: New World: Aeternum is one of the most underrated MMOs out there right now and it deserves your time.", "timestamp_created": 1749258495, "timestamp_updated": 1749259930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601155757904052734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

I bought the DLC because I figured a lot had changed and it was worth playing again. A new season has started, and a hardcore server is about to launch in the coming days. It’s a good time to give it a try. There’s a season pass with an option to buy premium access. That’s fine—many games have something like that. The free rewards are decent too. There’s a new storyline, modified areas, and added mechanics. I got really into it while playing on a fresh start server. There are lots of players. Finally, the HC seasonal server is launching… Everything looks great. I really like the accelerated leveling and item acquisition system.\n\nHardcore mode means that if your character dies, you can still keep playing, but you lose the ability to earn the seasonal reward given only to those who survive. That’s awesome—a real challenge, and a very difficult one at that.\n\nIf your character dies, you still have a chance to earn a different reward, but you have to focus on PvP and defeat players who haven’t died even once. To help with this, you get bonus stats after each death, making the task a bit easier. It’s an interesting and very engaging system that encourages open-world PvP.\n\nAnd here’s where my enthusiasm ends. Even though I paid a lot of money for the game, in order to unlock rewards from the main seasonal system, I have to buy the premium pass. Without it, there’s no point in even trying to avoid death, because it won’t get you anything. I’m simply excluded from the fun.

The world is gorgeous. Forests, ruins, sunsets—this game is pure eye candy.\r\n\r\n    Combat feels great. No tab-targeting here—every dodge, block, and swing matters. Very action-oriented.\r\n\r\n    Territory wars & PvP. Join a faction, fight for land, and actually influence the game world. Super addictive.\r\n\r\n    Crafting is satisfying. You can literally make a living off crafting and gathering. Everything you do matters.\r\n\r\n    Exploration is rewarding. Secret spots, rare resources, cool lore—it's easy to get lost (in a good way).\r\n\r\n🤔 What Could Be Better:\r\n\r\n    Some bugs and balance issues, though they’ve been improving with regular updates.\r\n\r\n    PvE content is a bit repetitive early on, but endgame expeditions and seasonal content help a lot.\r\n\r\n🔥 Final Verdict:\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy immersive worlds, skill-based combat, and building your own story in an ever-changing sandbox, New World is worth diving into. It’s not perfect, but it’s growing into something really special.\r\n\r\n✅ Recommended", "timestamp_created": 1748720153, "timestamp_updated": 1748720153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Though,  it's a pity that the devs are trying to mend the game into some theme park MMORPG with endless boring quests, whilst spending resources on voice-acted dialogue and cut scenes.

Ich weis gar nicht wie der eine oder andere hier überhaupt auf die Idee kommt das das hier für Solo Spieler geeignet ist.\n\nIch bin jetzt auf Stufe 65 und hänge bei Isabell fest. Ist ein Boss bei Quest Stufe 60. \n\nbis dahinhin kommen in der Questreihe  immer wieder so Mini Bosse die Du alleine nicht schaffst, das heisst Ich warte geduldig bis andere Spieler kommen um den Boss zu schaffen, manchmal kann das schon mal länger dauern. Also nix Solo\n\nDu kannst nicht einfach die Quest in einern Stück durchspielen weil Dir das Equip fehlt. Nun dachte Ich mir ein Artefakt kann Helfen, Artefakt ausgerüstet, muss aber erst gelevelt werden sonst ist es weniger Stark als ein Legi. Nun um dieses Artefakt zu Levelen, wie soll es sein Bosse die Du nicht alleine schaffst. Ich bin es leid immer auf jemanden zu warten, bis zum Boss musst Du erst mall durch ein  ganzes Areal was es auch in sich hat.\n\nAm meisten Sterbe Ich wegen der schlechten Controller Steuerung über PC, sie reagiert offtmals beim Waffenwechsel  von träge bis gar nicht. \n\nDas Spiel ist schwer und deshalb wenn Du ganz neu bist rate Ich Dir ab weil das Spiel wirklich schwer ist.\n\nFür mich ist erst mal schluss\n\nNach 61 Spielstunden\n\n\nDie Steurung mit dem Controller über PC ist sehr ungenau. Auch klappt der Waffen Wechsel nicht Reibungslos und Sterbe deshalb öffters mal in schweren Situationen\n\nBattle Pass ist künstlich in die Länge gezogen und 90 Prozent einfach überflüssig oder einfach erfarmbar. Was mich am meisten Stört ist die Tatsache das mir Vorgegeben wird wie Ich zu spielen habe um möglichst viele Punkt zu bekommen.\n\nEin einfaches Beispiel. Ich Folge ab Level 25 ab dem es den Battle Pass habe der Story habe viele Ressourcen gesammelt und in 35  Spielstunden ab Level 25 ganze 3 Level im Battle Pass gemacht weil Ich nicht nach den Aufgaben die einen Gestellt werden gespielt habe. Das heist aktivität wird nicht belohnt deshalb werde Ich auch nkeinen weitern Battle Pass mehr kaufen\n\n2 mal 3 Skills sind mir einfach zu wenig und dadurch wird oft die Waffe gewechselt ein Waffenwechsel der mit dem Contoller auf PC nicht zuverlässig Funktioniert. Auch gibrt es keine Ulti \n\nDie Abkling Zeiten der Fähigkeiten auch wenn die Reduziert werden können sind zu lang. Durch die schwammige Steuerung des Controlleers geht öffters mal eine Fähigkeit daneben.\n\nDie Welt wirkt oft sehr leer und da viel los ist musste Du sehr oft warten bis Mobs Respawnen \n\nEs gibt keine Weiblichen Kostüme im Shop sondern nur männliche warum auch immer und weibliche Charakter sehen nicht weiblich aus\n\nNun Ich will nicht nur Mekern sondern auch Sagen was Ich mag\n\nKomplette gute deutsche Vertonung für Haupt und Neben Quest, auch gefallen mir die Charakter wie Grace sehr gut, witzig und spritzig. Mach laune.\n\nAuch sehr gut die Art wie man sich in der Welt bewegt. Man kann zum Beispiel von einen Berg zu einer nahen gelegenen Brücke springen und sich dann Hochziehen. In anderen Spielen suchst Du dann umständlich den Weg. Bisher bin Ich in der Welt nicht hängen geblieben oder musste umständlich einen Zeitaufwändigen Weg finden\n\nHandwerk , Sammel macht sehr viel Spass und man kann die besten Waffen herstellen\n\nAlle Plattformen Play Station, X Box und PC können zusammen spielen.\n\nIch werde die Story auf jeden Fall zu Ende spielen und dann mich wieder nmeinen Haupspiel zuwenden\n\nMal schauen was sich in Zukunft in New World bewegt und das sich einiges Bewegt sieht man an der Raoad Map und deren Umsetzung.

Auch als Solo-Spieler hat man die Möglichkeit, sich gute und starke Ausrüstung zu erspielen, ganz ohne, dass man Echtgeld ausgeben oder Raids laufen muss. Jede Spielweise, jede spielerische Vorliebe kommt in NWA auf seine Kosten. \r\n\r\nDarüber hinaus ist das Kampfsystem ansprechend und doch keine Raketenwissenschaft. Es gibt jede Menge Gegner, die es in sich haben, was zu einem anspruchsvollen Schwierigkeitsgrad führt, der durchaus meisterbar ist und dennoch ein gutes Gefühl zurücklässt. \r\n\r\nDer Open World Gruppencontent, bei dem sich Spieler einfach spontan finden, so dass man auch ohne Gildenzwang und PvP das Gefühl erhält, Teil einer lebendigen Welt zu sein, rundet das Ganze ab. Und nicht zuletzt das sehr ansprechendes Housingsystem, das nicht so heftig einschränkt wie andere Spiele. Hinzu kommen all die guten Quality of Life Elemente, die mich als neue Spielerin sofort abgeholt haben. Ich habe noch nie ein Spiel erlebt, das mir gleich zu Beginn so viel Lagermöglichkeiten gibt oder mich recht schnell mit ausreichend Währung versorgt, egal ob es nun Gold oder Azoth ist. Danke an die Entwickler, dass sie sich schlussendlich so viel Mühe gaben, denn zu Beginn von New World war ich leider gar kein Fan. Das hat sich mit Aeternum vollkommen geändert. \r\n\r\nMein Fazit ist, wer zögert, weil es immer noch negative Bewertungen gibt, sollte sich bitte einfach selbst ein Bild machen. Das Spiel hat unglaubliches Potential. Und mal ehrlich, in welchem Spiel ist nicht mal ein NPC verbugt? Daran eine Bewertung festzumachen, ist für mich ziemlich albern.", "timestamp_created": 1748328372, "timestamp_updated": 1748328372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511686146259307861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

It’s rewarding, it’s challenging, and it’s why I kept coming back for thousands of hours.\r\n\r\nThe problem? Once you've done all that, there’s not much else to keep you going. Chest runs—aka joining a zerg to loot the same boxes every 24 hours—are straight-up boring.

What began as a PvP-focused survival sandbox evolved awkwardly into a full-fledged MMO, then struggled under the weight of inconsistent updates, endgame grind, and a bleeding player base.\n\nNow, with New World: Aeternum, Amazon isn’t just trying to patch holes—they’re rebuilding the ship and inviting console players aboard. And while it’s not a flawless rebirth, it’s the most compelling version of New World to date.\n\nThe fictional island of Aeternum has always been New World's greatest strength: a hauntingly beautiful, cursed paradise filled with ancient ruins, corrupted creatures, and factions vying for control. Aeternum doubles down on that promise with a more focused narrative structure, voiced dialogue, and expanded lore.\n\nThe new story content introduces stronger characters, better pacing, and a sense of purpose that was missing at launch. You still gather resources and level up, but now you’re not just grinding—you’re adventuring.\n\nCombat in Aeternum remains action-oriented—think dodge rolls, timed blocks, and skill-based strikes—but feels significantly more polished. The addition of target locking, improved animation feedback, and controller support make it feel less clunky and more deliberate.\n\nThe weapon system (you equip two, switching between them) continues to offer strong build diversity, and classless progression is still a major selling point. Want to be a heavy-armored mage who lobs ice storms while swinging a greatsword? You can.\n\nThe PvE content has seen noticeable improvements, and PvP remains an intense affair—especially in large-scale faction wars, which are now more stable and fun to participate in.\n\nAeternum preserves New World’s deep and rewarding crafting system. Nearly everything you wear, use, or sell can be player-made, and gathering professions feel meaningfully integrated into the world.\n\nBase-building in the form of housing gets expanded utility, offering more than just cosmetic flair—adding real bonuses and customization, especially for solo players. If you like life-sim elements baked into your MMO, this is where Aeternum shines brightest.\n\nWith its launch on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, New World: Aeternum introduces a revamped UI, controller support, and full cross-play. It runs well on console hardware, thanks to engine improvements and streamlined interfaces.\n\nFor new players, the onboarding experience is vastly improved. You’re no longer dumped into an overwhelming world without direction. Now, the game guides you with story missions, tooltips, and better pacing.\n\nAeternum has done a lot right, but it still inherits some of its predecessor’s grindy DNA. Mid-to-late game content can feel repetitive, and while gear progression is smoother, it still requires commitment. Some systems—like territory control—remain complex and time-consuming for casual players.\n\nAnd while cross-play is a great step forward, the game doesn’t quite bridge the gap between casual MMO fans and hardcore min-maxers. It walks the line—but not without stumbles.\n\nNew World: Aeternum is less a sequel and more a soft reboot, but it earns the right to ask for your attention again. The game is more focused, more fun, and far more complete than it’s ever been. It doesn’t reinvent the MMO genre, but it confidently reclaims its place within it—this time with sharper tools and a broader reach.\n\nWhether you’re a returning player or stepping into Aeternum for the first time, there’s finally a compelling reason to make this world your own.\n\nBest For: Fans of action MMOs, crafting-heavy progression, and immersive open worlds\n\nRating: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1747973250, "timestamp_updated": 1747973250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495972216129302979", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

The visuals are great and overall gameplay and combat are solid. The experience of getting to max level is pretty pleasant but once you hit max the experience quickly becomes a boring and relentless grind. Gear is centered around perks and max level gear will have 3 randomly assigned. Your job is to grind as much content as possible in the hopes of finding gear with the perfect combination of perks needed, I imagine several hundred hours would be required to get a full set. Its possible, but prohibitively expensive, to influence one of the perks when upgrading gear. Getting gear with all 3 desired is a very rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you might decide to craft gear instead. With crafting you can use randomly dropped items to influence one of the perks, slightly reducing the random chance of getting the gear you need. However, before you're able to craft max level gear you need to max out crafting. Very few people actually accomplish this because the amount of materials needed for levelling are absolutely staggering. To give an idea of just how much grinding is required you will need roughly 850,000 (yes, eight-hundred and fifty thousand) leather alone to level just armouring. With getting between 15-40 resources per node, you'll be skinning, mining, logging, harvesting for several weeks to get just one of the 7 crafting professions maxed out. If that wasn't bad enough the already limited resource nodes scattered throughout the world are often preyed upon by an army of bots and other players masochistic enough to attempt the humiliating grind to max crafting level.\r\n\r\nPvP is equally grindy and often completely baffling. Balance is a foreign concept in NW with seemingly minor changes uprooting well established class/builds rendering the current gear grind meaningless in one fell swoop. Some classes are absolutely useless in PvP altogether. Perks again play a major role in being successful in PvP, more so than with PvE. What perks you actually need is a mystery for the average player, the game gives no hint whatsoever as to what might make you survive just a few hits from veteran players. Unleashing your strongest attacks will often barely register on some players and devastate others. Although gear score is normalised for PvP the difference in having perfect gear perks and not is colossal. Unless you're prepared to dedicate your entire existence to min/maxing gear, I'd give the PvP a miss.\r\n\r\nThe final source of frustration is the prevalence of bugs that just should not be there. The game has been live for over 3 years and still suffers from embarrassingly simple but ultimately annoying glitches. Very often the map might not display everything correctly; the compass (no minimap here) frequently fails to register points of interest or gathering nodes nearby; UI elements get stuck on-screen; sudden crashes to desktop when logging in or an inexplicable failure to connect to the servers unless you do a reboot of your computer and router are common occurrences. Every new update will introduce new and exotic bugs to the experience.\r\n\r\nI honestly can't recommend NW to anyone looking for their next long term MMO.

Davon entfielen etwa 140 Stunden direkt auf die Zeit rund um den Release. Schon damals hat sich abgezeichnet, dass dieses Spiel etwas Besonderes für mich werden könnte.\n\nIn dieser Anfangszeit habe ich mich komplett auf einen Charakter konzentriert und mit ihm sogar die „Schwefelsandwüste“ durchquert. Doch als ich schließlich im sogenannten Endgame angekommen war, musste ich feststellen: Es gab nicht viel zu tun. Die Inhalte waren damals eher mau, und so verschwand New World für mich erst einmal in der staubigen Ecke meiner Steam-Bibliothek.\n\nUnd dort blieb es – ganze zwei Jahre lang.\n\nIn der Zwischenzeit widmete ich mich anderen Spielen: World of Warcraft, Forza Horizon und Co. Doch New World hatte ich nie ganz aus dem Blick verloren. Die Faszination blieb irgendwo tief im Hinterkopf erhalten.\n\nAls sich dann in WoW mal wieder die altbekannte Content-Flaute einschlich – und mir persönlich das neue Gebiet, die Goblin-Hauptstadt Lorenhall, auch überhaupt nicht zusagte – machte ich mich erneut auf die Suche nach einem Spiel, das mich wirklich packen konnte. Doch trotz des riesigen Spieleangebots zündete nichts so richtig. Ich probierte mal hier, mal dort, aber der Funke sprang nicht über.\n\nBeim ziellosen Durchstöbern meiner Steam-Bibliothek entdeckte ich plötzlich diesen vergessenen Diamanten wieder – New World. Mit der bald erscheinenden Saison 8 dachte ich mir: \"Warum eigentlich nicht? Probier's doch einfach noch mal aus.\"\n\nOh Junge – was für eine gute Entscheidung das war.\n\nRuckzuck war ein neuer Charakter erstellt, und los ging's. Anfangs war ich etwas überrascht von den Archetypen, aber schnell merkte ich, dass sich am grundlegenden Spielprinzip nichts geändert hatte: Waffe leveln, Builds optimieren – alles ganz ohne nerviges Klassensystem. Und genau das liebe ich an diesem Spiel.\n\nOptisch hat sich kaum etwas verändert – aber das ist gar nicht schlimm, denn New World sieht nach wie vor absolut fantastisch aus. Die Welt ist wunderschön gestaltet, die Soundkulisse wirkt lebendig und authentisch, und der Soundtrack? Weltklasse. So sehr, dass ich mir die Musik teilweise sogar auf langen Autofahrten oder beim Radfahren gönne. 😄\n\nDie Hauptstory rund um Artorius und Isabella wurde zwar teilweise nachträglich eingeführt, aber das merkt man kaum – vieles wurde so sauber integriert, dass sich die Geschichte rund und stimmig anfühlt.\n\nDas Kampfsystem ist für mich nach wie vor eines der besten im Genre – wenn nicht sogar das beste. Es ist nicht so überladen und komplex wie bei Black Desert, kein Click-Targeting wie in WoW und auch nicht so – entschuldigt den Ausdruck – „schwammig“ wie in ESO. Es fühlt sich einfach direkt, dynamisch und präzise an.\n\nWas New World für mich so besonders macht, ist die Freiheit, die es mir gibt: Ich kann stundenlang Holz hacken, Tiere häuten, nach Erzen suchen, Berufe leveln, Ruf farmen, mein Haus dekorieren, Expeditionen bestreiten oder mich ganz der Story widmen. Es gibt immer etwas zu tun – und das fühlt sich nie wie Arbeit an, sondern wie ein Teil eines großen Abenteuers.\n\nDie Story selbst ist komplett vertont, stimmungsvoll und macht Spaß. Sie ist gut spielbar, ohne dass man das Gefühl hat, man müsste sich durch endlose Texte quälen.\n\nJa, die Quests sind – wie in fast jedem MMO – oft nach dem bekannten Muster gestrickt: \"Hilf dieser Person\", \"Töte X Monster\", \"Sammle Y Kräuter\" oder \"Bringe dies von A nach B\". Aber das stört mich gar nicht. Denn Aeternum ist teilweise so liebevoll und atmosphärisch gestaltet, dass man sich gerne einfach treiben lässt – und dabei fast vergisst, was man ursprünglich vorhatte.\n\n\nFazit:\nNew World ist für mich wie ein guter Wein: Es musste etwas reifen, aber jetzt ist es genau richtig. Wer Lust auf ein immersives, wunderschönes MMO mit tollem Kampfsystem und vielen Möglichkeiten hat, sollte dem Spiel (wieder) eine Chance geben. Es lohnt sich – wirklich!\n\nP.S.:\nLasst euch den Spielspaß nicht von irgendwelchen Miesepetern oder frustrierenden Erlebnissen in Expeditionen oder Raubzügen vermiesen. Jeder Rückschlag ist auch eine Lektion – und mit jeder neuen Erfahrung werdet ihr besser. Bleibt dran, bleibt entspannt und vor allem: Habt Spaß! Denn ein MMO ist genau das, was man selbst daraus macht. 😊", "timestamp_created": 1747724561, "timestamp_updated": 1747812237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Whether it’s cooking, blacksmithing, or woodcutting, crafting is well-designed and makes you feel like you’re progressing even outside of battle.\n\n[u] Beautiful and Immersive World [/u]\nThe game looks stunning. From glowing forests to misty ruins, the world feels alive and is a joy to explore. It’s easy to get lost in the scenery—in a good way.\n\n👎 [b] Cons: [/b]\n\n[u] Low Player Population [/u]\nServers can feel pretty empty at times. It’s harder to find groups for certain content, and towns can feel a bit like ghost towns. This affects how social and active the game feels.\n\n[u] Endgame Feels a Bit Repetitive [/u]\nThe early parts of the game are great, but once you hit the high levels, there isn’t as much to do. The endgame content doesn’t have the same excitement and can start to feel a bit samey.\n\n[u] Not Easy for New Players [/u]\nGroup content can be tough for newcomers.

But now they drove the community to the ground. There were so many deflations, so many quests problems, that the game is now almost dead. You never cross many people, when there is someone, you see on the streets afk. Towns are dead, guild wars is like 15x15 players and not more than this. There is no one to do early dungeons with, so you cannot even do by yourself by over leveling. So yeah, you are stuck without doing a lot of things in game cause it requires more players. It is ok for the new story, but shitter if you want a mmo, go for WOW or Guild Wars, forget about this one. This one deserves to be buried for their own greed.\n\nAND i forgot to mention, they made paid mounts. The game is expensive by itself, now they are charging you with if you want mounts.

Однако, несмотря на свои сильные стороны, игра сталкивается с множеством проблем, которые не позволяют ей стать тем, что она могла бы быть.\r\n\r\nПоложительные моменты:\r\n\r\nМир и атмосфера. Aeternum — красивый и разнообразный мир. В нем есть все для того, чтобы быть увлекательным: густые леса, величественные горы, заброшенные города и таинственные руины. Все это создает отличную атмосферу для исследования.\r\n\r\nБоевая система. Система боевых действий в New World достаточно динамична и интересна, особенно для игроков, которые любят участвовать в реальных сражениях. Нет классов, и система навыков позволяет игрокам развивать персонажа в разных направлениях.\r\n\r\nМножество активностей. Игра предлагает разнообразные способы взаимодействия с миром: от PvE до PvP, крафт, добыча ресурсов и строительство. Есть чем заняться для каждого типа игроков.\r\n\r\nОтрицательные моменты:\r\n\r\nТехнические проблемы и баги. На старте игра столкнулась с массой технических проблем, включая падения фреймов, ошибки в квестах, и проблемы с серверами. Многие из них были исправлены с момента релиза, но все равно время от времени встречаются баги, которые могут повлиять на игровой процесс.\r\n\r\nОднообразие контента. Хотя мир большой и красивый, к сожалению, геймплей может стать довольно однообразным. После нескольких часов игры, квесты и активности начинают повторяться, что делает игру менее увлекательной на долгосрочной перспективе.\r\n\r\nГринд и экономика. New World требует большого количества времени на прокачку и крафт, что иногда превращает игру в настоящий гринд. Экономика в игре также иногда вызывает вопросы — рынок нестабилен, и многие элементы могут быть переработаны.\r\n\r\nPvP-система. Хотя концепция PvP-сражений и войн интересна, она часто сводится к проблемам с балансом. Бои бывают не всегда сбалансированными, а механики могут быть не столь глубокими, как хотелось бы.\r\n\r\nПрогрессия персонажа. Прокачка персонажа не ощущается такой значимой, как в других MMORPG. Это, возможно, связано с отсутствием классов, что делает развитие персонажа немного плоским. Также система умений не всегда позволяет почувствовать реальный прогресс.\r\n\r\nЗаключение:\r\n\r\nNew World: Aeternum — игра с огромным потенциалом, но она еще не достигла идеала. Проблемы с багами, однообразие контента и слабая прогрессия персонажа могут оттолкнуть часть игроков. Если вы любите красивые миры и исследования, эта игра может быть интересной, но если вам важна глубина и инновации в игровом процессе, возможно, стоит подождать еще несколько обновлений, прежде чем вернуться в Aeternum.", "timestamp_created": 1747406385, "timestamp_updated": 1747406385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438756227493286133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Back then, it was a visually stunning but flawed experience, plagued by repetitive quests, a lackluster PvE loop, and technical hiccups like long queues and bugs. Fast forward to 2025, and New World: Aeternum feels like an entirely different game—in the best possible way. If you haven’t played in a while, it’s absolutely worth giving it another shot.\r\n\r\nA Revamped Experience\r\n\r\nThe core of New World—its gorgeous world, action-based combat, and deep crafting system—remains, but nearly every aspect has been polished or overhauled. The leveling experience, once a slog of repetitive fetch quests, has been completely reimagined. The Brimstone Sands update and the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion introduced a more narrative-driven main storyline with cinematic cutscenes, voiced characters, and engaging lore that pulls you into the mystical island of Aeternum. Questing now feels purposeful, with varied objectives and a stronger sense of progression.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of mounts (horses, wolves, and lions) has addressed one of the biggest early complaints: excessive running. While the quests to unlock mounts can be a tad tedious, they drastically improve mobility, making exploration across Aeternum’s diverse landscapes a joy. The addition of new zones, like the visually stunning Ebonscale Reach and the reimagined First Light, adds fresh content and variety to the map.\r\n\r\nCombat and Gameplay: Smoother and More Dynamic\r\n\r\nCombat, always a highlight with its real-time, skill-based mechanics, has been refined further. New weapons like the Great Sword, Void Gauntlet, and Blunderbuss expand build diversity, while tweaks to weapon swapping and animations make fights feel more fluid. The classless system, where your abilities are tied to weapons and attributes, remains a refreshing departure from traditional MMOs, and the ability to respec easily encourages experimentation.\r\n\r\nPvE content has seen significant upgrades. Expeditions (dungeons) are now more engaging, with challenging mechanics and unique enemies, especially in mutated versions. The Rise of the Angry Earth expansion added a new dungeon that, while not perfect, offers thrilling encounters. Enemy variety, a weak point at launch, has improved, though some reskinned mobs still linger. For solo players, the open world is more accessible, with activities like story quests and faction missions that don’t require grouping.\r\n\r\nPvP, a cornerstone of New World, shines brighter than ever. The addition of 3v3 Arenas, a new open-world PvP zone, and a rewarding PvP track has reinvigorated competitive play. Territory control and faction wars feel more meaningful, with large-scale battles that foster community and strategy. Whether you’re a solo player or part of a company, there’s something for everyone.\r\n\r\nQuality-of-Life and Endgame Improvements\r\n\r\nQuality-of-life changes have been a game-changer. Fast travel is cheaper and more accessible, group finders make forming parties easier, and the expertise system for gear progression has been streamlined. The endgame, once a tedious grind, now offers a variety of activities: mutated expeditions, elite world bosses, and Outpost Rush (OPR) provide diverse ways to chase high gear scores. While some players still find the endgame loop repetitive, it’s a far cry from the barren state at launch.\r\n\r\nThe economy, once chaotic due to duping glitches and a lack of coin, is more stable, with a player-driven market that rewards dedicated crafters and gatherers. Speaking of crafting, it remains one of the most satisfying systems in any MMO, letting you gather, refine, and create everything from weapons to housing decorations.\r\n\r\nA Vibrant World with Room to Grow\r\n\r\nAeternum’s atmosphere is unmatched, with a dynamic weather system, immersive sound design (thanks to composers like Ramin Djawadi), and breathtaking visuals powered by the Lumberyard engine. The game’s transition to a free-to-play model in 2023, with an optional premium battle pass and cosmetic-focused in-game shop, makes it more accessible, though some players grumble about the paid Rise of the Angry Earth expansion locking mounts and certain content.\r\n\r\nThere are still areas for improvement. Some dungeons could use more innovative boss mechanics, and the endgame can feel grindy for hardcore players. Performance issues persist for some, depending on hardware, and the lack of swimming remains a quirky immersion-breaker. However, Amazon’s commitment to regular updates and community feedback is evident, with each patch building on the last.\r\n\r\nIs It Worth Playing in 2025?\r\n\r\nFor those who played at launch and left disappointed, New World: Aeternum is a revelation. The game has evolved from a promising but flawed MMO into a robust, immersive experience that rivals genre giants. Newcomers will find a beginner-friendly entry point with enough depth to keep them hooked for hundreds of hours. Returning players will be blown away by the improvements—faster leveling, richer storytelling, and a more rewarding endgame make it feel like a true second chance.\r\n\r\nIf you’re an MMO fan craving a vibrant world, satisfying crafting, and dynamic combat, New World deserves your attention. For just a one-time purchase (or free-to-play with some limitations), it’s a steal, especially with the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion adding significant value. I’ve sunk countless hours into Aeternum since day one, and I’m still excited to log in. Give it another shot—you won’t regret it.\r\n\r\nScore: 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1746808450, "timestamp_updated": 1746808450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Zuallererst ist es mal ein Buy - To - Play Titel. Das ist für mich schon mal sehr gut, da es keine Monatlichen Kosten hat. \r\n\r\nEs gibt ingame zwar einen kaufbaren Season - Pass, den man allerdings nicht gezwungenermaßen kaufen muss. Obwohl es einen kaufbaren gibt, wurde hier trotzdem an alle Spieler gedacht, da es einen kostenlosen Season Pass gibt. Und hier sind tatsächlich auch tolle Dinge dabei und auch keinen Müll, den man von so manch anderem MMORPG kennt. Hier gibt es auch mal Skins, die man bekommt oder sogar Währungen, mit denen man selbst etwas aussuchen darf. Für mich ist das hier tatsächlich etwas besonderes.\r\n\r\nHier ist wirklich für jeden etwas dabei:\r\n\r\n- detailreiches Crafting - System\r\n- man kann eigene Charaktere erstellen\r\n- es gibt zwar die Holy Trinity (Tank , DD, Heal) aber man kann hier jede Waffe tragen, die man möchte\r\n- Skills werden erlernt, indem man das tut, was man möchte. Man kommt z.B. im Crafting weiter und höher, wenn man es macht. Man nutzt die Waffe, die einem gefällt und levelt sie dadurch.\r\n- Dungeons (Achtung: hier kann man nur mit mind. 3 Spieler rein. Alles darunter geht hier leider nicht, mehr ist möglich)\r\n- Raids\r\n- Tolles Housing System. Hier kann man sogar erbeutete Trophäen ausstellen, um Boni zu bekommen. Nicht nur toll dekorieren, sondern auch davon profitieren. Allerdings zahlt man an die momentan herrschende und inhabende PVP Gruppe Steuern. Diese allerdings sorgt dafür, dass die Stadt upgegradet wird mit diesen Steuern. Davon profitiert man dann wieder selber. Also ein dynamisches System.\r\n- es gibt PVE und PVP - beides kann und nichts muss. Für mich ein Riesen Vorteil =) \r\n- Fischen, was sehr intuitiv ist.\r\n- es gibt eine Gruppensuche\r\n- man kann Companin erstellen, was Gilden gleichkommt\r\n- Im Game selbst gibt es 3 Fraktionen, die wichtig fürs PVP sind. Diese kann man allerdings alle 30 Tage wechseln, falls man möchte. \r\n- Emotes nutzen und sogar Musik spielen, indem man sich selbst oder andere Spieler Buffs geben kann. \r\nAuch kann man hiermit Geld verdienen und mit anderen gemeinsam musizieren =D \r\n- Mounts, die man sich selber erspielen kann (hier benötigt man allerdings Angry Earth DLC)\r\n- es gibt auch einen ingame Shop, der allerdings weder aufdringlich ist, noch schnell zu finden. Zudem gibt es hier keine Dinge, die einen weiter bringen oder das Game maßgeblich beeinflussen. Lediglich Skins zum verschönern, die man haben kann, aber nicht muss =D \r\n\r\nMan kann auch unglaublich viel auf der Karte erkunden. Überall hat man Quest, die man erledigen kann. Hier geht es von Gebietsquests bis hin zu kleineren Quest, die man von z.B. Gegenständen wie einer Kette, erhält. \r\n\r\nAber auch ein bisschen Negatives gibt es von meiner Seite aus:\r\n\r\n- innerhalb von Städten ist es trotz guter Hardware sehr ruckelig und stockend. Gerade zu den normalen \"Gamezeiten\" am Abend und am Wochenende.\r\n- die Deutsche Übersetzung ist mehr wie Grauenhaft. Vor allem das Gendern ist hier nur noch lachhaft und so im Vordergrund z.B. bei den Titeln (Naturliebhaber*in......) dass es weder Sinn noch Verstand hat. Auch in den Quests ist es sehr verwirrend. Da ist mal ein Mann, der von anderen plötzlich als \"Sie\" angesprochen wird und der Quest den kompletten Sinn wegnimmt, da man ewig nach \"ihr\" sucht... oder die Quest absolut nicht verstehen kann. Für mich geht so etwas gar nicht und gehört hier auch nicht hin.\r\nHier muss ich leider sagen, dass ich mich entschieden habe, auf Englisch zu stellen, da dies viel besser, runder und schöner ist. An meinem Beispiel der Titel: Hier steht dann Nature Lover. Viel besser oder? \r\nMan muss sich nicht überall die Deutsche Sprache zerstören lassen und ehrlich gesagt, ist dass Englisch hier leicht zu verstehen. Sollte es euch dennoch schwer fallen, ist es sogar möglich Untertitel einzustellen =D \r\n\r\nAnsonsten kann ich allerdings nicht meckern. Alles, was man hier macht, sei es Crafting, Dungeons, Fischen usw. hat alles Sinn und man spürt merklich, dass man seinen Charakter weiter bringt und alles einen Zweck hat. \r\n\r\nIch kann euch das Spiel nur empfehlen. Ob Roleplayer, Abenteurer oder einfach mal in andere Welten eintauchen: Hier findet ihr einen schönen Ort, wo man viel erleben kann. Alleine oder mit Freunden und Partner- es lohnt sich vorbeizuschauen.\r\n\r\nKlare Empfehlung und euch viel Spaß =D", "timestamp_created": 1746475985, "timestamp_updated": 1746475985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593631923198699951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Came to revisit the game 2 years later.\n\nThis is a really fun game, and it's very immersive with lots to do but has a really strange player base. If you're someone who likes fishing, wood chopping, hunting, harvesting, mining, crafting weapons and armor, etc, you will probably like this game. If you are familiar with Runescape, it is very similar to that game with all the skills you can level such as the ones previously mentioned. If you like Elder Scrolls Online, you might like this as well. If you like doing nothing but standing in town and trading at the auction house, there's that as well. You can also own houses and decorate them.\n\nCombat is very fun and actually feels like you're making contact with the enemy compared to other MMO's such as WoW. There are lots of quests if you're someone who likes questing by yourself. 2 years ago I used to skip through some of the main quests because I thought it was just boring honestly, but ever since they overhauled it a little bit and introduced Rise of the Angry Earth I have been enjoying myself a lot more and not skipping quests. There are also mounts now, 2 years ago they did not exist and you had to run everywhere on foot (though you have to buy the dlc to access the mounts which I think is silly). Not a huge complaint about buying the dlc to access mounts because at the end of the day the entire game is free and you only really have to pay once and then the rest of the game is yours to play forever with no subscription bulls**t, which is great.\n\nThe graphics are really amazing. I love exploring zones like Edengrove because of how colorful and exotic it looks, and also the surrounding woods from the Windsward area. Sometimes I just go right outside of Windsward and just chop trees for like 30 minutes simply because of how pretty nature looks in this game. They did an excellent job with the environments and the overall atmosphere of the game, which is why I think it is extremely immersive.\n\nThe community is still weird like I remember it. Lots of arguing, s**t talking, trolling, stage 5 clinger type personalities, you name it, people saying \"dEaD gAmE\" every 2 seconds like 9 year olds (doesn't seem as bad now, 2 years ago it was incessant though). Some random person once private messaged me wanting to go troll people for some strange reason (I guess because they saw something I said in chat and got the wrong impression of me due to misinterpretation of tone through text, etc). I ignored them because I thought they were an idiot. So they got mad and started harassing me for not wanting to be mean to other people, but the thing is that I didn't do or say anything that could have given them the idea that I logged in this game specifically to be a moron. I guess their own goofy perception told them I was a sociopath like they were based on a comment I made? It makes absolutely no sense and I still scratch my head about it lol. Also, I remember having a question about a character in the game in regards to the story (nature lady, I believe Adiana Theron is the characters name) asking why she is so angry at humanity and someone came out of nowhere and said \"You must not be married, that was a jab at women\". \n\nI sat for like 5 minutes trying to rationalize and figure out how their comment had anything at all to do with the question I asked (made absolutely no sense). Some of these people will take the smallest things and turn it into something that has absolutely nothing to do with anything at all just for the sake of conversation and trolling, I just don't get it.... but I guess that's the nature of MMO's in general. If you don't speak these people's lingo, you'll be confused. Perhaps I am witnessing a bit of brainrot and I don't realize it? Who knows. Makes my brain hurt honestly. Stuff like this is why 2 years ago I said \"Stay away from global chat or your IQ will drop a lot if you engage\" and based on my personal experiences I still stand by that. My personal theory is that the game's community is the way it is because of PvP being a heavy focus in New World, and in turn that will attract edgelords and super toxic types lol. It's the same thing with WoW, amazing game and really beautiful world filled with the most terrible and goofiest people you can imagine. It's sad really, but I digress.\n\nBut don't get me wrong, as I said, this is a very good game and you will most likely be immersed in it's gorgeous world and perhaps have fun with tradeskills or pvp stuff if you enjoy going to war with other people. If you're an introverted type of person you will probably still enjoy this game, there is something for everyone here.

Both share a somewhat simple combat system at first glance, but New World stands out by offering a more refined and rewarding experience. Unlike Neverwinter, which is often criticized for its problematic monetization and pay-to-win mechanics, New World manages to avoid these pitfalls, allowing players to focus on the game without constant distractions from microtransactions.\r\n\r\nCombat System:\r\n\r\nAt first, New World’s combat may seem simplistic—at least in comparison to some other MMOs. However, the more you play, the more you’ll appreciate the underlying depth. If you’ve ever played World of Warcraft (or any other game with a tab-targeting system) and found yourself wishing there was a bit more skill required in landing those chaotic, powerful attacks, New World will scratch that itch.\r\n\r\nThe combat system is dynamic and engaging, requiring real-time positioning, dodging, and aiming. It's a refreshing take on the traditional MMO combat mechanics, and it provides a level of satisfaction that’s hard to come by in games that lean too heavily on a \"press-button-and-wait\" approach. Whether you're wielding a sword, casting spells, or swinging a warhammer, every action feels deliberate and impactful, making the battles feel more like a test of skill than simple number crunching.\r\n\r\nStory and World Design:\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features of New World is its incredible world-building. The environment is amazingly crafted, and the level of detail in both the visuals and the lore is remarkable. From the dense forests and foggy swamps to the snow-covered mountains, each area has its own unique feel and atmosphere. It's clear that the developers put a lot of thought into creating a living, breathing world that’s rich in history and filled with opportunities for discovery.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is intriguing, though it serves more as a backdrop for the exploration and survival elements. That said, the world of Aeternum—the setting of New World—has enough depth to pull you in and keep you invested in its mysteries. Whether you’re uncovering ancient ruins or delving into the story behind the corruption that plagues the land, the narrative weaves seamlessly into the gameplay, offering plenty of incentives to explore every nook and cranny.\r\n\r\nCrafting System:\r\n\r\nThe crafting system in New World is another highlight. It's comprehensive without feeling overwhelming. There’s a real sense of satisfaction when you gather resources and craft items, whether it’s weapons, armor, or consumables. The system is complex enough to feel rewarding but doesn't require excessive grinding or micromanagement. Whether you’re an experienced crafter or someone new to the mechanic, there’s something deeply satisfying about creating items that directly impact your gameplay. Plus, the materials and crafting stations are scattered across the world, making crafting an integral part of your journey, not just a side activity.\r\n\r\nOverall Impressions:\r\n\r\nSo far, I don’t have a lot of negative things to say about New World. The game excels in so many areas: the skill-based combat, the stunning world design, and the rewarding crafting system all come together to create an experience that feels fresh and exciting. There’s a good balance of depth without overwhelming the player, and the attention to detail in the game world is evident in every corner.\r\n\r\nIf you’re someone who’s looking for a traditional MMO experience with more skill-based combat and a world that feels alive, New World is definitely worth checking out. It’s a refreshing change from the typical MMO formula, and whether you’re a fan of Neverwinter, World of Warcraft, or other MMOs, this game brings something new to the table without the frustrating pay-to-win mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1745954383, "timestamp_updated": 1745954383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Foi uma aposta do estúdio de jogos da Amazon para com o público de MMO e vou te falar que foi uma ousadia em tanto. O jogo consegue acertar em vários pontos sendo história, design de produção e alguns sistemas de guerra que eu achava muito legais. Agora para os pontos negativos poderia resumir na falta de experiência da Amazon Games em fazer jogos e apostar num gênero tão difícil de entregar. Indo mais à fundo seria as missões vazias (ou fat quests) que deixam a gameplay muito mais tediosa, o endgame sendo um farm gigantesco e repetitivo para conseguir itens melhores, mas o pior de tudo é sentir que a Amazon Games não escuta direito a comunidade. Isso tudo acabou afastando muitos players o que é uma pena. Foi meu primeiro e último MMO pois esse gênero consome muito tempo e preciso viver, porém guardarei com carinho o prazer e jogar um jogo tão social e ter vários momentos felizes com a galera da guilda.\r\n\r\nRecomendo? Pelo preço atual jamais, e ainda que a playerbase está aos poucos indo embora.

Si queres ser tank de aguante, tenes varias formas de hacerlo, si queres ser tank y aportar daño/utilidad, tambien tenes varios recursos. Si queres curar, podes hacerlo con el báculo de vida en el arma principal y en la secundaria podes tener un arma que aporte utilidad al equipo o también daño. En cuando a los DPS, hay miles de combinaciones que podes usar. Dependiendo de donde vayas, si raid, mazmorra o pvp, podes elegir el arma que mas se adapte a tu forma de juego. En caso de raid (la tipica 1 vez x semana y tal) hay armas que sirven mas que otras por su forma de juego, por sus habilidades y es bastante interesante estudiarlo. Si te gusta el PvE, lo mas parecido a una mitica plus en el wow es hacer mazmorras en tiempos records, tambien usando determinadas armas, determinada composición con respecto a tus otros 4 compañeros. En cuanto al PvP puedo decir que podes pelear con cualquier arma.\r\n El juego te da la info, te toca leerla, entenderla y encontrar tu roll dentro de este precioso mundo de new world. \r\nCabe recalcar que no todo depende de que armas uses, sino que tambien dependes del equipo que lleves. Casco, pechera bla bla, joyería.. Como en todo MMO serio, hay estadísiticas y beneficios que debes respetar para que tu equipo sea lo mas excelente posible, pero ya te digo, hay millones de formas para equiparse, millones de \"builds\". Eso es bastante atrapante, lo prometo.\r\n En cuanto a la gente, como mencioné, no es tóxica.. Suele pasar de que la misma comunidad pone en la lista negra a quienes intentas pasarse de graciosos y se genera un gran ambiente.\r\n El juego es pago, no es para nada ptw, y la comunidad es pequeña. Tienen que mejorar en algunos aspectos como bajarle el precio al juego o promocionarlo mas para que haya mas atracción. Como todo MMO, necesitas tiempo para todo. Nada es gratis y las cosas cuestan lo que tiene que costar.\r\n Recomiendo muchisimo ver algun PoV de Raid ya sea gorgonas o gusano para que veas que en este juego existen las mecanicas y hay que usar discord si o si para coordinar entre varios. \r\n Jugué toda mi vida al wow, desde muy chico que me encantaba ver los MDI. Por cuestiones de trabajo+universidad tuve que dejar ese juego. Ahora que estoy estabilizado con mis proyectos personales, no tengo tiempo para wow pero si para New World y si estas en la misma que yo, este juego es para vos.

Here’s my veteran take:\n\n👍 Pros:\n\n✔ Immersive Exploration – Aeternum’s biomes (lush jungles, misty swamps, snowy highlands) are gorgeous, and stumbling on hidden shrines or dynamic world events never gets old.\n✔ Deep Crafting & Player Economy – Gathering, refining, and crafting gear feels impactful. Playing the auction house and cornering a market on rare materials is genuinely satisfying.\n✔ Epic Faction PvP – Outpost Rush and 50v50 Territory Wars are adrenaline-pumping. Coordinated sieges with siege weapons and strategic choke points make for memorable battles.\n✔ Flexible Combat Builds – With five weapon types and armor weights, you can go light-and-agile with dual blades or slow-and-strong with halberds and heavy plate. Dodge mechanics and weapon synergies keep combat engaging.\n✔ Steady Live Updates – Amazon’s added new expeditions, quality-of-life patches, and seasonal events since launch, smoothing out many rough edges.\n\n👎 Cons:\n\n❌ Late‑Game Grind – Chasing gold‑tier gear demands repetitive boss runs, crafting loops, and gear score farming. Once capped, goals narrow to PvP ranks or cosmetic drops.\n❌ Technical Hiccups – Server desync, rubber‑banding, and occasional quest bugs still pop up, breaking immersion. Some expeditions have pathing or trigger issues that require resets.\n❌ Population & Queues – High‑traffic zones can lock and spawn long queues; low‑pop servers struggle to fill faction fights.\n❌ Faction Imbalance – Many servers see one faction dominate territories, making it tough for underdogs to catch up unless you reroll.\n❌ Repetitive PvE Tasks – After unlocking fast travel, most side missions feel like “kill X” or “gather Y,” which can become rote.\n\n⚖ Final Verdict:\n\nNew World is at its best when you’re adventuring with a company, mastering a quirky weapon build, or laying siege to a fortress under a blood‑red moon. But the endgame grind, server quirks, and occasional bugs can wear you down. If you love open‑world PvPvE, deep crafting, and large‑scale warfare—and don’t mind repetitive loops—this will keep you busy for a long time.\n\n⭐ 8/10 – A beautiful, ambitious MMO that rewards camaraderie and strategy, but tempered by grind and technical rough spots.\n", "timestamp_created": 1745181834, "timestamp_updated": 1745181834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528402984142303467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Builds are great to play with, the game looks and feels gorgeous, and I have had many fun hours playing it. So why do I not recommend it? Because of the one thing this game just cant get right. The end game.\n\nLevelling to max level (65) is fun, but very very fast. Before you know it you're there and you're asking yourself \"what now?\". The answer? PvP. Yes that's right, take part in all the PvP aspects of the game. Cool, you may think. I love a bit of PvP action. Step into a war or an outpost rush and get absolutely creamed in a second. Why? Because your gear is trash and to be even remotely competitive you have to spend hundreds of hours grinding out crafting levels so that you can upgrade your gear to be remotely decent so that you can be dragged through the highest level content (because, lets face it, your gear is still trash), to have a remote chance to get a piece of gear that is going to be what you need to make your build decent. Before all of this, don't even bother getting into that PvP stuff, you will just lose.\n\nThe game has no balancing to speak of. You are not put into content against players with similar gear score, not that that would help you as the power difference between a very high 710 gear score and the max (725) is that vast, that the 710 can barely even scratch the 725.\n\nSo how do you get there? How do you get to that last 15 gear score that seemingly turns you from a feeble peasant into a master of death and destruction? GRIND... grind your a$$ off!!! I'm not talking about Elite: Dangerous levels of grind (love that game btw), no no no... Elite's grind levels have nothing on this game. If you've ever played Elite, then you know what I am talking about. How any game could beat that in terms of grinding is beyond me, and yet, I give you New World!\n\nSo lets say you need to get yourself to level 250 in Engineering. You would start by crafting 28 Treated Wood Bows to get to level 50. This requires 336 Timber, 336 Rawhide and 56 Linen. Doesn't sound too bad, right? Let me go on...\n\nTo get from level 50 to 100, you're best off crafting 89 Lacquered Wood Spears. This requires 979 Lumber, 445 Iron Ingot  and 178 Course Leather. But to make the Lumber, you need 2 Timber for every 1 piece of Lumber, so add to that recipe 1,958 Timber. For every Iron Ingot, you need to farm up 4X that amount if Iron Ore, so that is 1,780 Iron Ore that you have to find.\n\nThese numbers get worse the higher in quality you go. All recipes require 2 for 1 of the previous tier till you get to the top tier. To get from 205 Engineering to 250, you need to make an astonishing 178 Mythril Blunderbuss (or relative equivalent of other recipes). This requires a grand total of 1602 Mythril Ingots. So to make 1 Mythril Ingot, you need 12 Mythril Ore, 2 Orichalcum Ingot, 1 Flux, 2 Charcoal. (I hope I'm not losing you here). The 2 Orichalcum requires 8 Ore, 2 Starmetal Ingots, 1 Flux, 2 Charcoal. Starmetal costs 6 Ore, 2 Steel Ingot, 1 Flux, 2 Charcoal. Steel costs 3 Iron Ingots, 1 Flux, 2 Charcoal. Iron Ingots cost 4 Ore.\n\nTo make 178 Mythral Blunderbuss, you need (Just the metal)\n1,602 Mythril Ingots (19,224 Ore)\n3,204 Orichalcum Ingots(25,630 Ore)\n6,408 Starmetal Ingots (38,448 Ore)\n12,816 Steel Ingots (38,448 Iron Ingots (153,792 Iron Ore))\n48,060 Charcoal (96,120 Timber)\n24,030 Flux (which you may find around 7 of in a chest on occasion, if you're lucky)\n\nDo you see where I am going with this? Each node will give you from about 7 to 60 Ore depending on size and your character's gear. But that's if the node is even there in the first place because some other player has got to it first and taken it.\n\nI made a spreadsheet detailing how much grinding you actually had to do to get just a single trade skill to 250, but gave up when I started to breach the millions of materials that you need for just 1 trade skill. \"Just buy from the Trade Centre!\" Yes but players have their prices set so exorbitantly high that you can go bankrupt just trying to make a few levels.\n\nAll in all this game is the biggest grindfest of a game I have ever played. You have to do the grind to be even remotely competitive, and this game is probably the worst game for any newcomer.", "timestamp_created": 1744717471, "timestamp_updated": 1744879248, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Unfortunately, the current state—with heavy aim assist and target lock mechanics, especially on consoles—has made it nearly unplayable for PC players who value skill-based competition.\nThe assist features allow players with little to no skill to simply point and shoot. Shots unnaturally curve around obstacles like trees and corners, and no amount of movement or dodging seems to help. If you're a PC player looking for fair, skill-based engagements, this game may no longer be the right fit\n\nHealers Got Gutted – Disappointed and Frustrated\n\nAs someone who has mained a healer in New World since launch, I’ve never felt more discouraged. The recent nerfs have completely ruined the experience of playing a support role. Healing is no longer fun or effective – it’s become a frustrating chore.\n\nThe changes to healing output, cooldowns, and stamina management make it feel like we’re being punished for choosing to help others instead of dealing damage. Group content is now a nightmare. I used to feel valuable in Expeditions and PvP – now I just feel like dead weight. It’s impossible to keep up with damage, especially when the enemies hit harder and our healing tools have been drastically weakened.\n\nWhat’s even worse is the lack of communication or justification. It feels like the devs have caved to the loudest DPS players and forgotten the people who held groups together. Healing should be rewarding, not a constant uphill battle.\n\nIf this was meant to encourage more diverse builds, it’s backfired. Instead, you’ve driven support mains away. I’m seriously considering switching roles or quitting altogether – and I know I’m not the only one.\n\nFix this, New World.

Its not a \"No Man's Sky\" or a \"Cyberpunk 2077\" style rebirth, but its a much much better game today.

The tone also feel really uneven and outright cartoonish in some circumstances)\n- Factions are interesting but there's something missing (covered below) \n- Invasions are a cool idea but... (more below)\n\nWhat's missing:\n- 'Class identity/fantasy' (your weapon load-outs determine your role and which 2 stats you're gonna dump all your points into; little incentive to spread your points into other attributes outside of you main damage outputting stats resulting in little in the way of building a true identity outside of that)\n- An 'indigenous' faction (you play entirely as a settler and whilst there are 'nature-aligned' people in the story, you never really get to side with them a la GreedFall. This faction could be oriented towards fighting the corruption of the island and resisting the influence of colonists)\n- No incentive to specialise in specific crafting vocations (everyone can max all crafting skills like Runescape; cheapens the building of 'character identity')\n- Greater variety of skill builds among weapons (combining 2 weapon types could unlock a new set of abilities that can be used when either weapon is equipped)\n- The consequences for failing an invasion don't feel all that meaningful (settlement upgrades get reduced slightly; would be better if the settlement was wiped and the subsequent corruption of place had to be 'purified', 'destroyed', or 'contained for study' prior to resettlement; this would also give factions the opportunity to genuinely 'leave their mark' on the world in a meaningful way and deepen their respective character and provide more PVPVE content).\n- Could lean more into survival elements (ie a weather/environmental system that has an impact on resources, character performance, weapon, armour, and tool durability to create money-sinks to benefit the economy, etc.)\n\nOverall it's a fun game and I'm enjoying it casually. Assuming there's developer appetite for more expansions, which may sadly not be the case, some of the missing items above could be partially addressed. I think it's a good experience that struggles to be genuinely great. It makes some bold moves for the genre, but never fully commits to them which leads to some disappointing missed opportunities.\n\nAlso, the buy price is too damn high. I know this game cost heaps to make, but the box price is a real barrier to entry for lots of people.

Game is literally just a bug in itself, and you need to treat these bugs like mechanics of the game. You are likely to start noticing bugs pretty quickly, and some are pretty annoying. Please do not let this change your mind about buying the game though. I bought the game in January knowing exactly what the state of the game was, and it was in fact worth buying. You really have to go in with low expectations, that is how you set yourself up for the best possible experience.\n\nNew World is dying... New world has been dying for years. The developers don't care, and we rarely get anything new that is enough to keep the player-base strong. Latest big update was a pvp update that introduced seasonal pvp servers to the game that are just not fun for players that don't enjoy being killed constantly and jumped by 10+ players while trying to finish a quest. This update also split the already small community. We should have had more pvp related updates to bring life back to the main game, not just a server that closes at the end of the season for minimal rewards.\nWe need more content for those of us who already completed everything hundreds of times...\n\nAmazon Games refuses to reward their players for grinding their content... If you are a fan of raiding, and endgame content in mmos. This game has a really good raid called Hive of Gorgons. Before I get into what it is and how to prepare for it, I want to let yall know about the weekly rewards... The Hive raid will only give you loot once per week, this includes schematics, which are used to craft endgame gear or you can sell them for a profit. I think its a 1/200 chance to get the schematic on your first clear of the week(reset day is every Tuesday at I think 5 am). If you are unlucky like me, you can do over a hundred raid clears and still not get the drop because I did not clear 100+ Hive raids by doing them once a week. I clear multiple times a week every week and only get armor and weapon drops on Tuesday reset day. \nThe only thing that you do get daily that could potentially be useful, but its not for most people are the damaged gorgon's eyes. You have to do an insane amount of perfect scaled up expeditions(dungeons basically). This is just to get 1 hive cache that has a random rolled piece of gear in it from the raid. Most people don't have groups that can consistently clear these expeditions to that level which means that those eyes will just pile up until the devs decide to make a change(I recommend just holding onto them, if we are lucky, maybe they will become useful.)\n\nHive of Gorgons: Hive is not a piece of content that is easy to get into because the community is pretty toxic when it comes to giving new players a shot at clearing. I had to lie to get into hive raids saying that I was experienced and new what I was doing to start getting into them, and most of the time, that didn't work because they will ask to check your gear before inviting you.\n\nIf you want a chance to start getting into Hive and start getting good solid experience, please read what I am about to say:\n\nThere are multiple roles that you can play in hive, this is not exactly as simple as dps, healer, and tank. You have to build a bit more specifically if you want an invite to the raids unless you are lucky.\n\nList of widely known roles: Tank(usually want sword and shield with the leadership perk in the skill tree to boost your groups damage by 10%. Offhand could be a few things, won't get much into that rn.)\n\nHealers(Need a lifestaff, and void gauntlet with the oblivion perk in the skill tree. wont get into details rn).\n\nDps(this is the role that has a lot of diversity, and it is going to be your best shot at getting into a raid).\nAs a dps, there are a few main roles that are needed in a proper Hive comp. Evade Rapier, Bleed Rapier, and Rend Bot.\n\nEvade: This is your best option to get into a raid and get some clears without people staring at you constantly. Just follow the group and work on maximizing your dps. In this game, gear score does not matter nearly as much as gear perks, so here is a list of perks to get before linking your gear to raid leaders: 4-5 pieces of enchanted ward on armor, 4 stacks of refreshing on armor/jewelry(no more than that as its max stack is 4), omnidirectional evade on an armor piece, and leeching flurry on an armor piece. Do not have regenerating on your earring as that can lead to pulling aggro from tank, avoid that heavily. Good way to find gear like that is to go into the trade post and filter for a perk until you get all of the perks needed. You will want your gear to be mostly yellow tier, with some red tier(can only have 1 artifact piece for armor, weapons, and jewelry on at a time.)\nThe artifacts you will want to start with to get into the raid are going to be Attuned Leather Pants(artifact pants from main story quest ending. Make sure to put health on these pants while learning so people don't question your life choices. This requires upgrading at a gypsum kiln. I won't explain how, you will just need to figure it out or research since I am limited here). Make sure to stay in a light equip load as any dps role. ALP are a medium pair of pants, so build accordingly because in a light load you get +15% damage.\nFinisher(This is an artifact rapier that is pretty much best in slot if you add the perk, distained infliction as your upgraded perk. This is very important, do not leave this out in your evade build.)This rapier will be obtained in elysian wilds on the isle of zurvan. You have to get a group together to kill the 3 elemental elephants, and wait 6 minutes for the big one to spawn and kill that until you get the drop. Best way to get a group is to go into recruitment chat and say x up for finisher farm or something like that, then invite players to a group that x up in chat.\nEndless Thirst(This is a solid starter artifact that helps make health potions heal for more and some other useful perks for survivability. Just put refreshing toast on it to counter the longer cooldown on potions.) \n\nIf you have all of that stuff, you should be good to go as an evade. Just make sure you are using the rapier skills, Evade, Flurry, and Riposte or you are not playing as an evade. Please look up a build for evade rapier and follow that for the skill tree. That will help tons. \n\nyour attributes should be set like this: 25 focus(5%cdr), 25 strength(+5% damage to melee weapons), 350 dex(as close as you can get), and the rest into intelligence. Constitution is not desired as a dps, your goal is damage, so get used to dodging attacks, but use con food if you need the extra health(attribute food from trade post).\n\nmake sure while learning to use a bow/musket as your offhand. These scale well with rapier, and are really good for first and 3rd boss. 2nd boss, always melee(its a dps check. melee does more damage with rapier, and staying on the boss avoids a bunch of mechanics.\nI will not get into each of the other roles rn due to limited space. I am just posting evade in its full form because it is your absolute easiest way to get into Hive, and you can expand from there when you know the raid.\nMore in comments :(", "timestamp_created": 1744320915, "timestamp_updated": 1744320980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

But after a while I lost interest as the end game felt like it was lacking the appeal to play anymore, anyone that got to endgame in 2021 knows it was not great there was little to do and the progression felt tedious. \n\nBecause of this I stopped playing, but when I saw they were re-launching the game I thought the developers might actually be trying to do something, so I when it re-released as New World Aternum I thought why not try it out. \n\nWhen starting a new character to see the new starter area I felt the abundance of NPC dialogue was nothing but slop that they felt they had to write so the characters didn't just seem like mannequins staring at us, as I continued to play it seemed like there weren't many changes to combat and AI movement with the mobs and that is where I decided to stop playing. Needles to say I was disappointed that the game felt worse.\n\nAlso the fact that end game is locked behind a $50 dollar DLC when the game is $90 is absolutely ridiculous and honestly disgusting to see for the developers to do, it really made trying to get friends to get back in the game with me so hard, as I was riding around on a mount they asked \"how do you get that?\" and I disappointingly had to respond saying you have to spend $30 dollars to be able to get mounts in the game, and they were pretty put off by that which is fair.\n\nOverall the changes were fine but I felt there was nothing drawing me back into the game.

By release i was excited, a new mmo, cool, and an AAA Titel, too.

You run araoud, do a few quests, yes there are raids, ok, that´s it. Only very few people do pvp on in game. In other mmos i loved a cool story and even in much older mmo the graphic is much better. The quests are monoton, nothing new, run here and there, ok, a raid, and then, bored. That´s what i can say from my personal opinion. Sometimes i come back, to check if the games has developed in a better way for me, frustratingly i found the graphic more worse than by release. Maybe a downgrade to aquire more players.

I stopped playing some time ago. BUT I will say, if you have played it in the past and haven't been back in awhile, take the chance. There are many games that make an amazing comeback after some rough years, and this IS one of them.\r\n\r\nIf you're choosing not to play based on negative reviews and the angry individuals that are hung up on the past, you will miss out on an awesome MMO. Just saying.\r\n\r\nI've been an avid MMO player for 20 years. Played everything on the market that can even be considered an MMO. And even all the sandbox survival crafting, RPG, etc. New World feels fresh, and revamped. I normally get bored quick with things, this has kept me occupied like games used to years ago. Which is rare. The starting area takes a minute to get past before you really see the games potential. Make it past that and you will start to see everything unfold. \r\n\r\nQuesting doesn't feel like a chore. They have combined elements from different genres in my opinion, to make it an MMO. But it works, and feels fluid. I'm excited to continue leveling and see where things take me. I am just sorry I didn't make it back to New World sooner! This will be my main squeeze for awhile, as I am bored out of my mind with WoW. \r\n\r\nI have no run into any bugs or lag whilst playing. Servers are refreshingly MORE populated than I had expected. Going into New World from a fresh perspective, I was worried all the negative Nacy's had scared away the player base, but it is definitely there. And the game doesn't feel dead at all. I've seen more people in the open world questing and farming to craft, than I do on my WoW servers. Here's to hoping New World continues to get a steady flow of new players, it's a whole new game and deserves some credit. \r\n\r\nI found a large Company / Guild that is friendly and actively doing end game content, that's very open to new players. I didn't expect that either. There's a nice community of people in this game.\r\n\r\nLong story short, BUY the game and give it a fair and honest try. If you have played it when it was in it's darker years, TRY it again, it's well worth it now. \r\n\r\nHappy leveling, see you in New World!", "timestamp_created": 1743098857, "timestamp_updated": 1743098857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Depois do level 40 você começa a reparar que o jogo fica repetitivo, e que os mesmos inimigos que você enfrentava lá no level 1 estão também nas áreas de level 40, 50, 60, com mais vida, mais dano, dificuldade maior. Esta pouca variedade em inimigos persiste até hoje, após 2 expansões, pelo que pude notar. \r\n\r\nO conteúdo end game em 2022 era sofrível. Havia um sistema de watermark que não convém explicar pois não existe mais (amém). \r\nO jogo estava infestado de bots coletores de recursos e bugs que estragavam completamente a economia do jogo. Dizem que isso melhorou. \r\nOs devs também não sabiam balancear as armas e armaduras. Eu abandonei o jogo em 2022 justamente por causa disso. Era ridículo entrar num campo de batalha 20x20 e notar que absolutamente TODOS os 40 jogadores estavam de armadura pesada e uma destas 3 armas: Machado, Martelo ou staff de healer (sim, o healer também usava armadura pesada). Estes setups não eram levemente superiores, mas obrigatórios. O guerreiro de machado com armadura pesada corria mais que arqueiro pelado, o dano dele era ridículo, e a redução de dano da armadura pesada era mais ridícula ainda. \r\n\r\nVi comentários dizendo que o balanceamento do game melhorou com as atualizações, o que me fez reinstalar o jogo hoje (e desinstalar 30 minutos depois). \r\n\r\nA Amazon transformou as atualizações/expansões Angry Earth e Aetherum em conteúdos obrigatórios, e são caros. Ela matou o jogo para quem só tem o jogo base.\r\nVocê não é \"obrigado\" a comprar, mas se não comprar, não poderá passar do level 60. Dungeons que existiam no jogo base foram removidas. Itens bons só dropam em dungeons das expansões. Montarias e outras mecânicas não estão disponíveis para quem tem apenas o jogo base. As profissões só vão até lvl 200.\r\n\r\n- Sem as expansões você não participa do PVP (talvez como saco de pancadas). \r\n- Sem as expansões você não entra em dungeons, está automaticamente excluído do conteúdo PVE também.\r\n- Sem as expansões você não tem acesso a montaria.\r\n-Sem as expansões você não participa da economia do game, pois não vai poder craftar nada além do lvl 200. \r\n\r\nAlém disso os servers estão vazios, tem em torno de 800 pessoas jogando nos servidores da America do Sul divididos em 3 ou 4 servidores.  800 pessoas era o que tinha na fila para entrar no jogo em cada um dos em torno de 15 servidores quando lançou em 2021.\r\n\r\nEm resumo:\r\nO jogo é caro, precisa comprar a expansão que é cara, é repetitivo, poucos players ainda jogam, e a Amazon Games não é uma empresa confiável como produtora de games, tendo em vista que vende algo e remove conteúdo posteriormente. \r\nEu estou excluído de um jogo que comprei no lançamento caso não compre a atualização, considero isso desrespeitoso. \r\n", "timestamp_created": 1742615446, "timestamp_updated": 1742615446, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881313025951385498", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

I have 2200 hours in this game for a reason. It's genuinely enjoyable when it comes to how the game plays. The PVP is exceptionally fun, the PVE is challenging in a way that I have not seen in other MMOs - especially tab target MMOs like EQ2 or WOW. However, the harshest criticism I would add is that there is a lack of new content in the game and the development team doesn't seem to understand what is wanted in an MMO. \r\n\r\nSeasonal servers are not the direction that we need to go moving forward. MMOs are about building the character you have and exploring new content annually. Adding the Hive of Gorgons was a great addition, but running the same content week after week becomes monotonous, especially when a lot of the content has been in the game for years. We need a few things in this game to make it great:\r\n\r\n1. New Raid Dungeon each season. Seasons should introduce a new storyline, and new content for PVE. Right now, we don't have an engaging new addition to the storyline since Rise of the Angry Earth. This is needed to maintain gameplay.\r\n\r\n2. We need a new overland zone. There is talking about the Dev team reworking Reekwater - which is nice, but at the same time, part of what makes me enjoy MMOs is that occasionally there is something new to explore. New storylines to uncover. New harvestables to go get. We have been missing that.\r\n\r\n3. We badly need new expeditions and mutations. I love the expeditions in this game, they are well thought out (minus certain mechanics that are added purely to waste time - such as carrying the Azoth Staff half way across the map in Garden of Genesis and Starstone Barrows). Additionally, only allowing 3 mutation dungeons per week makes the game feel far too grindy. Like there are only 9 in the game, and yet each week I am limited to running the same three over and over and over which makes a game which is already small seem even smaller from a PVE standpoint.\r\n\r\n3. We need new PVP maps - luckily there is another OPR being added, but we need new matches besides 3V3 and OPR. We need some new games like capture the flag.\r\n\r\n4. The PVP zone in CK is an utter failure. It really adds very little to the game besides going to get your goldcursed coconut every Tuesday. A better method would be the PVP from Nagrand in WOW. Where every 4 hours somebody can take over a town. Then the three colors can fight for it every so often.\r\n\r\n5. Storage needs to be consolidated and I should be able to manually organize things. It is so frustrating that each time I come back to my storage shed items are in a different order. Also the search bar at the top is annoying because if you type two letters, it makes me open different screens.\r\n\r\nMake some quality of life changes, and add content, and this game would be wonderful.

Les graphismes sont magnifiques et l'ambiance apocalyptique médiéval est super un MMO avec des zombies il fallait y penser c'est vraiment sympa comme jeu. Sérieusement on a l'impression d'être dans un Final fantasy online en monde ouvert, tout est beau les décor le ciel c'est très réussit. Un monde vivant ou on peut activer le pvp pour conquérir des zones c'est sympa!!\nJe n'ai pas encore tout saisi des stuffs possibles et imaginables mais il y a l'air d'avoir pas mal de composition.\nPar contre peu de sort on a trois sorts par armes et deux armes au choix, donc six sorts à choisir sur douze c'est très limité.. je n'ai aps encore testé le PVP je reviendrai rajouter des choses à mon commentaire..\nPour conclure c'est un bon MMORPG qui a tout les ingredients pour en faire un MMO aussi bien que wow ou guild wars 2, il est un sérieux concurrent par ses graphismes et son style unique de zombies médiéval. Des métiers qu'on monte en choisissant ceux qu'on veut monter un peu comme ALbion mais en 3D.\nJe testerai le pvp pour voir ce que ça donne.\nedit ! Les donjons parfait grosse difficulté quand on connait pas excellent je trouvais les autres mmo ennuyant à spamm nos sorts et rouler sur les donjons ici c'est plus compliqué mon premier donjon 60 j'ai galérer on est mort 3 fois au moins c'est un vrai RPG avec des boss épic et des victoires méritantes j'adore ce MMO !!!\nVraiment new world aeternum est le meilleur mmo du marché foncez !!!!\nPar contre l'économie du jeu semble inutile on obtient nos équipements puissants en donjons on récupère énormément d'équipements et beaucoup sont liés au personnage gros point négatif du jeu selon moi, sur ALbion on peut tout vendre il y a un réel intérêt à avoir beaucoup de pièces que dans New world aucun intérêt on se stuff facilement en donjon et la plupart du temps on ne peut pas vendre nos équipements obtenus ou très peu cher on voit du stuff violet épique à 3 pièces d'argent c'est pas énorme.\nPareil le craft d'équipements les objets sont liés au personnage aucun intérêt..\nça tue l'économie.\nPareil le leveling est facile en suivant la quête principale et en faisant quelques donjons aléatoire en une semaine de jeu seulement j'ai up niveau max niveau 65.. Il faudrait rendre l'expérience plus compliquée comme un vrai RPG ou monter de niveau est significatif.. Je propose de monter le niveau maximum à 75 dans la prochaine extension mais sans l'xp 50% des donjons aléatoires.

Weapons/gathering skills are tied into the attributes. for example, an occultist, has fire staff/ice Gauntlet weapons and their damage is based from 100% intellect. the tie into the gathering skills lowers it for me and just feels out of place. the bonuses are nice but they really ought to have them intertwined with the skill's themselves.\n\nWeapon Skills: 6/10 instead of the player having a skill tree the weapons do. you can play around with different ideas to run each weapon, your gear will also play a role in this, some gear gives unique bonuses to certain weapon skills. as i reached max level on my occultist i noticed other occultists using the same builds and the only difference that separated us was the gear we had vs pvp sets.  You are not stuck using just your starting archetype, you can train and use every weapon as long as you meet the level requirements and of course respecing your attribute points to work on a different build is 100% doable at any time for a small cost.\n\nGathering skill: 5/10  mining ore, skinning animals, woodcutting, picking local/rare flora for special ingredients/cloth fibers, and fishing in your favorite watering hole. Gathering skills are really fun and you'll be doing them forever so let that adhd run high. the issue. you are going to be fighting with a lot of players for some resources. you'll be competing for the more rarer nodes later on. you have a chance of getting special materials as a rare drop when Harvesting a node and most are needed for crafting recipes and Gems for jewel crafting when mining ore. maxed out skills have nodes that are added to the skill experience circle. each node has a star rating crate with materials in them that you earn.  1, 2 and 3. contains decent materials so farming doesn't feel empty.\n\nProduction skills: 5.5/10 From Smelting ore, weapon crafting, armor crafting, stone cutting, jewel crafting, Weaving, Cooking, Workbench(for tools, unique items., Tanning, and arcane(potions, unique magic weapons/potions and Materials). you will have a lot of materials and most of the stuff you make you'll end up just salvaging to get resources back. midway through and quarter through some skills will need multiple sources of materials. Materials get costly and leveling some skills like armor/weapon crafting can be expensive whether you buy or farm materials. speaking of costs.\n\nThe Trade Post (auction house): 4/10 the biggest thing about the game is gold, getting gold, buying things, selling things. working on craft and prepping for content. you will find that the amount of gold vs amount of time gathered does no equal up and as always the devs and the player base are to blame. with either very minimal type of an item being over priced then to over saturated gear taking up pages no one buys from. end game content and pvp are the main focus so a lot of gear that would be good is grossly overpriced. that gathering skill you've been working on well someone else is already selling 15000(not an exaggeration) of that resource you want to sell at an already heavily cut and cheapened price. making both gathering/crafting skills almost seem pointless until you get to the late game items and even then the most important items you need drop from raids or certain higher difficulty. not user friendly and the search options are not accurate/wrong when setting them. trade-post effects the gathering/production skills score in this review because together they effect the overall economy in the game.\n\nMaking other characters/alts on the same server: 0/10 don't bother. you do not have a shared storage and no mail system like warcraft. you can respec points anytime to try out a different build. you'll be doing enough dungeons/buying getting sets of gear for pretty much every build. players will sell low tier at high cost, have alt buy item to transfer gold.\n\nFactions: 4/10 3 factions. Gear/items store available. more stuff per rank. complete quests until you reach ranking tiers, then do a special quest to rank up. Faction tokens and gold to buy items. the gold needed for items in the last ranks rewards are outrageous.  pvp locations for your faction for bonuses. settlements can have a faction in lead of it. giving unique perks. definitely a fun thing i see people fighting a lot so i know it is something pvp'ers enjoy doing. BUT server pending factions are over populated and have a tendency to reign supremacy so some real QoL changes are needed. there are other pvp things to do which i have not done but there is enough to have fun. the equipment you can buy really is not that great and outdated from what i can tell. i wouldn't mind owning a set of the faction gear for the looks but i cannot justify the price. also the store has some items that you absolutely need for some crafting. the gear is not updated to end game gear-score. factions feel more like an after thought. you've beaten the base game and just want to keep busy and max out rank.\n\nDungeons/raids:  6/10 easy once you get into doing them a few times. extra bonus for doing random Dungeons twice a day.\n\nElite areas: 5/10 hate them. you need to play with others. you'll need to bug general chat or play on a busy day and hope to run into others.\n\nBattle pass: 5/10 the rewards you get with the free portion of the pass are mediocre for a while until you get to the higher levels. premium costs about 20 dollars. you have a Bingo card to fill in and challenges to earn stamps for that card, then you get a new card and keep adding exp to the battle-pass. there is a list of challenges you cant get unless you purchase the premium pass. the premium rewards are far superior right from the very beginning.\n\nMONSTERS:6/10 great enemies but half way through you start seeing the same enemies in just different cosmetics. with a few differences to area bosses ect. \n\nMounts: 5/10 you get three mounts for free by doing the quest to earn each one. others need to be purchased.\n\nConclusion: New world Aeternum is an average mmo experience with a few highlights. then it starts to kind of go down hill because of dev choices or lack of. since it's debut it has had numerous server mergers to help with population issues. which then in turn cause economy issues and pvp faction issues.  they also have created seasonal servers which only separates the player base and does not help in the slightest. The game is fun all the way through but max level and endgame content is where things started slowing down. if you do want play new world i suggest buying it while on sale.\n\nThank you for reading this. please leave a reaction and of course i am open to comments. plus if i got anything wrong or off don't be afraid to let me know. i want to be a good reviewer one day. i do expect trolls and trolls are important.

Ce titre ambitieux tente de conjuguer une narration riche avec des systèmes de gameplay variés, tout en affichant quelques points perfectibles. Voici une analyse objective de ses points forts et faibles.\n\nHistoire / Scénario – 8/10\nL’intrigue se déploie dans un monde aux mythologies et aux légendes bien travaillées. Le récit principal est captivant et offre plusieurs rebondissements, même si certains segments narratifs, notamment dans les quêtes secondaires, manquent parfois de profondeur.\n\nQualité – 7/10\nLe jeu séduit par une direction artistique soignée et des environnements visuellement attrayants. Néanmoins, quelques incohérences techniques dans les textures et animations indiquent que le polish global pourrait être amélioré pour atteindre des standards plus élevés.\n\nPerformance – 7/10\nSur la majorité des configurations, New World Aeternum propose une expérience globalement fluide. Cependant, dans les zones fortement peuplées ou lors d’événements massifs, des baisses de frame rate peuvent survenir, suggérant un besoin d’optimisation supplémentaire.\n\nGameplay – 8/10\nLa diversité des activités – combat, exploration, artisanat et coopération – offre une expérience dynamique et engageante. Le système de combat est réactif et bien intégré à l’environnement, mais certains mécanismes répétitifs dans la gestion des quêtes peuvent réduire l’immersion sur le long terme.\n\nDiversité – 8/10\nLe jeu se distingue par une grande variété d’environnements, d’ennemis et de modes de jeu. Cette richesse de contenus permet aux joueurs d’explorer différents aspects du monde d’Aeternum. Toutefois, quelques zones bénéficieraient de contenus événementiels plus dynamiques pour parfaire l’expérience.\n\nConclusion\nNew World Aeternum est un titre ambitieux qui parvient à proposer un univers riche et varié, soutenu par un gameplay engageant et une narration captivante.

(Je pense notamment au PvE, les quêtes redondantes etc.. j'ai recommencer une partie et c'est une belle surprise de voir de nouvelles cinématiques, de nouveaux PNJ qui rentre dans le Lore du jeu)\r\n- Un côté PvP poussé (PvP Sauvage, capture de forteresse, conquête de ville, 3v3..) et qui va tendre à l'être probablement plus avec les nouveaux serv full PvP \r\n- Un farm, des métiers et des crafts variés, le farm vous permettant aussi d'augmenter le lvl de votre personnage.\r\n- Des armes et gameplay variés pour tous les goût\r\n- Des combats et mécanique de combat très correct (plus que pas mal de jeu)\r\n- Un système de tirs très agréable et qui n'est pas en visée auto (+retombée de flèches, quasiment pas de distance max, voir pas du tout ?)\r\n- Un MMORPG où l'on retrouve pas mal d'interactions entre joueurs, beaucoup de rencontres sympathique !\r\n\r\n\r\nNégatif : \r\n- Les bugs que l'ont a eu au début (mais comme tous les jeux qui sortent j'ai envie de vous dire), on retiendra aussi les files d'attentes qui on été une catastrophe, mais pas besoin d'approfondir ces bugs étant résolus)\r\n- Les changements de serveurs récurrents dû aux Hypes du jeu que l'on a eu au début, lors de DLC..\r\n- Personnellement, les serveurs temporaires ne sont pas ma cam du tout, je n'aime pas et je ne peux pas recommencer 10 fois le jeu, cependant  le recommencer après 3 ans et tout le travail fait autour de l'histoire est un plaisir ! \r\n- La gestion des inventaires dans les villes, qui a été simplifié avec le temps, ce n'est pas catastrophique non plus, mais j'ai eu l'impression de passer beaaaaucoup trop de temps à ranger / détruire etc .. (A savoir que je suis un gros farmeur et que je m'intéresse à tous les métiers, donc une infos à prendre avec des pincettes)\r\n- Une population assez basse, et peut être que comme moi certains attendent un vrai renouveau et un contenu spécifique pour revenir sur le jeu (Comme les serveur full PvP)\r\n-  Un peu frustrant de devoir payer pour accéder à tous le contenu (Zone, monture ..), mais il suffit de comparer le prix d'un abonnement chez d'autres MMORPG pour se rendre compte que c'est tout à fait correct. et tout travail mérite salaire.\r\n- Le système de commerce pourrait être amélioré / simplifié parfois\r\n\r\n\r\nEn résumé je dirais que pour un MMORPG, il a beaucoup d'avantages, en passant de la beauté du jeu, du gameplay très satisfaisant, aussi pour le coût qui est correct, ou le système n'est pas lié à un abonnement, Des devs qui sont à l'écoute, et qui communique, + un jeu qui évolue en partie avec les critiques de la communauté.\r\nUn nombre de joueur un peu bas à mon goût, mais qui se maintient, en plus avec l'ouverture de NW sur console (et pour un MMORPG il est encore très jeune)\r\nL'ouverture de serveur PvP est une très bonne idée et pourrait me faire relancer New World, bien que je n'ai pas envie de recommencer un personnage sur lequel j'avais beaucoup investi, surtout sur un serveur temporaire.\r\n\r\nMerci pour le travail des équipes NW en tout cas, de très bons moments passé dessus !\r\n\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1741468306, "timestamp_updated": 1741468306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Your first quest? Kill three boars. Your second quest? Kill more boars. Your third quest? Please, for the love of God, kill even MORE boars. And just when you think you're done—guess what? The boars respawn.\n\nCombat is dynamic and engaging, in the sense that you will engage in combat and then dynamically get stun-locked to death by a level 6 turkey. And PvP? Oh, it’s glorious. Nothing quite like running for 20 minutes across the map, only to get deleted in 0.3 seconds by some guy in a glowing purple hat named \"xX_DeathWizard_Xx\" who has literally never left the warzone since launch.\n\nThe economy is a beautifully broken masterpiece. Need gold? Too bad! All your crafted items are worthless because everyone else is crafting the same junk and dumping it on the market for 0.01 coins. But don’t worry—just take a few deep breaths, sell your soul to a faction, and do your daily taxes like a good little settler.\n\nAnd let’s talk about the real endgame: chopping wood. Forget raids, forget dungeons—true power in New World comes from your logging level. You will spend hours leveling it. You will lie to yourself and say, “Just one more tree.” And before you know it, it’s 3 AM, you’re half-asleep, and you're questioning whether you’ve become a virtual lumberjack in a past life.\n\nYet, despite all this—the grind, the pain, the endless faction drama—I keep coming back. Why? Because somewhere between being scammed in the trading post and dying to a mosquito, New World does something magical: it makes suffering fun.\n\n10/10.

It does some thing very well. The gathering and fishing are the most satisfying I have played in any MMO or survival game. The graphics design is amazing and when working is a breathtaking game.

I will say in its defense I am playing on a 2021 Ailenware gaming laptop, not a ultra powerful, newest released graphic card, ram etc, desktop.  I get the feeling when playing that it lacks polish and feels more like a early access game than something that has been out for a few years and comes with the Amazon logo when lauching. I expect more and better simpily from the Amazon logo but maybe Im expecting too much. It has a feeling of laziness and imcompletenes. Very repeatative and the \"new to me \" MMO feel wears off rather quickly. As far as community goes, well if you have played any MMOs in the last ten years, you will be unsurprised to hear that it is jusst as toxic as some mainstream MMOS (looking at you WoW) and in fact on the PVP only server it bring back not fond memories of when WoW had pvp only servers. 10/10 wouldnt recomend unless you hate yourself ...... oh and it has micro transactions for skins and a battlepass!! what more could you love about it.", "timestamp_created": 1740614335, "timestamp_updated": 1740614335, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627839267253875732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

This game is amazing for the first 400 hours. Currently I have decided to put a pause on it because I have maximized my dps character and my Tank Build is pretty much complete as well. So here  is my pro and con list:\n\nPros:\n1. the classes are super flexible, you do not have to make different characters when you want to switch from dps to tank for example. This makes quality of life amazing on the game. I had a hard time deciding on what weapon to use so I easily made a gear set for each and picked what I liked the most.\n2. the scenery is beautiful, great graphics.\n3. with the market place your choices to making money are endless. you pick the price you want to buy or sell, it's like the stock market where I like to buy items for low prices and then try to sell it to make profit.\n4. the dungeons are fun to play.\n5. there is a grind to farming gear but for the most part it is not exhausting. most of the time an item drops after a good days worth of grinding. unless if you want life ring... that can take a week or 2 haha.\n6. The players you meet are very helpful, I have made some good friends in this game. \nCons:\n1. Lack of content when you get to end game. I can see many things I can max out when it comes to crafting and gathering however I am not that guy. All that's available for end game is a weekly raid called hive of the Gorgan. It is daunting when you first try it however once you get your gear in line and have a solid team you can run through these once a week. what's there to do after? nothing really. I only get one once a week for the raid then I end up playing something else.\n\n2. PVP tends to be a bully fest. If you are not in the best faction in your server, you will get out numbered in pvp areas. I am talking 10 v 1 demolitions. There are PVP match making like outpost rush which is an even 15 v 15 but it becomes repetitive since it's always the same map. then there is 3v3 Arenas but that is a pain because anyone can que up as tank so 9 times out of 10, your team loses because you don't have a true tank to take the damage. \n\n3. unfortunately people are losing interest so lately it has been a little rough trying to match up with people for random dungeons or farming items from world bosses that requires atleast 5 people that are farming for the same item as you.\n\nMessage to the Devs:\nStop putting focus on Throne and Liberty. It's only advantage is its Free to play. Listen to your new world community and give us more end game content please. I love this game but I need there to be more things to do in the end game.", "timestamp_created": 1740528308, "timestamp_updated": 1740528308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Durante minha experiência, nunca encontrei problemas em combates, seja no PVP ou no PVE, relacionados a bugs, erros de alvo ou falhas no cálculo de dano. No entanto, a progressão do jogo é extremamente rápida, permitindo que o jogador alcance o ápice de todas as mecânicas — como nível do personagem, últimas dungeons, itens, fabricações, entre outros — em um curto período. Quando joguei, alcancei o endgame em apenas quatro dias.\n\nAs guerras são um dos pontos altos do jogo; nunca imaginei que um game desse gênero pudesse oferecer batalhas 50x50 tão envolventes e bem estruturadas. No entanto, acredito que a progressão do conteúdo precisa de ajustes urgentes. Embora as mecânicas \"mutadas\" tenham sido adicionadas, ainda são insuficientes. O jogo deveria oferecer, no mínimo, oito novas dungeons com dificuldades variadas, incentivando os jogadores a buscarem novas estratégias e perks para otimizar seus itens BIS.\n\nOutro ponto a ser aprimorado é o armazenamento, que se torna bastante limitado para jogadores de endgame. No meu caso, frequentemente precisava gerenciar cerca de 5kk de peso para estocagem, transporte e fabricação, e eu tinha 3 das maiores casas, com os melhores baús, e todos os assentamentos cheios. Além disso, a expansão do mapa é fundamental. A adição de pelo menos seis novas regiões com níveis mais altos traria mais longevidade ao game.\n\nSe a desenvolvedora focasse na criação de mais conteúdos desafiadores e na ampliação das possibilidades dentro do jogo, certamente eu o jogaria por muitos anos. No entanto, isso não diminui a qualidade da obra. Quero reforçar que AMO esse jogo, mas, infelizmente, suas limitações tornam difícil manter o interesse..", "timestamp_created": 1740442657, "timestamp_updated": 1740442657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Jetzt stehe ich seit drei Stunden im Wald und hacke Holz, weil ich meine Siedlung verbessern will. Abenteuer? Nein. Ich bin offiziell zum mittelalterlichen Waldarbeiter geworden.\n\nGameplay – „Warum rennen die Wildschweine schneller als ich?“\n\nNew World gibt mir eine riesige offene Welt, spannende Kämpfe und eine Story … die ich komplett ignoriere, weil ich zu sehr damit beschäftigt bin, nach Eisenerz zu suchen. Ich wollte ein Held sein, jetzt bin ich ein professioneller Sammler von Leinenstoff und habe eine tiefe persönliche Feindschaft mit Truthähnen entwickelt.\n\nKämpfe – Schwert, Axt oder doch Magie? Egal, ich treffe eh nichts.\n\nDas Kampfsystem ist spaßig und dynamisch, bis ich feststelle, dass ich meine Ausdauer in den ersten zwei Sekunden verbraucht habe und jetzt wie ein erschöpfter Rentner um den Gegner herumrolle. Und wenn mich ein Boss trifft? Sofortiger Besuch auf dem Friedhof.\n\nWirtschaft – „Willst du 500 Steine für 2 Gold kaufen?“\n\nDie Spielerökonomie ist wild. Ich versuche, meine hart verdienten Waren zu verkaufen, nur um zu sehen, dass jemand anderes sie für den Preis eines nassen Toastbrots anbietet. Also gut, dann behalte ich halt meine 500 gesammelten Bäume und starte ein eigenes Möbelgeschäft.\n\nPvP – Wo ich lerne, dass ich doch kein guter Kämpfer bin\n\nIch dachte, ich bin bereit für den Kampf gegen echte Spieler. Dann treffe ich auf eine PvP-Gilde, die in perfekter Formation anrückt, während ich noch versuche, mein Schwert aus meinem Inventar auszurüsten. Spoiler: Ich habe verloren.

The game itself has been ultimately enjoyable, albeit unbalanced and rather lacking in mechanics for how long its been out, and how clear the fan base has been about what they want. The Devs made one thing clear in the last 4 years; They don't care. Makes some sense since this entire game is a proof of concept for some lotr project. They only follow through with their promises when things start looking bad for them. The thing is, everything I've mentioned so far I've accepted as the norm. Just like any abusive relationship, I've been tricked into accepting this unacceptable behavior. the anvil that broke the camels back, however, is a recent server merge. Maramma to Valhalla. Valhalla is a \"Legacy Server\" Which is AGSs fancy way of saying that there were so many bugs back then that the economy is permanently damaged.

The respawns have also been broken for some time making losses much easier simply due to the game not loading your character after 45 seconds which is insane even on a high end computer.\r\n\r\nThe recent changes to TTK have also ruined the skill base aspect of this game for PvP making it simply who can hit who first and do the most damage with their styles (or burn), its no longer having to time abilities to try and work thru that heal pot to kill a person or land your abilities in good order, just smash and go which is a sad state for this game with how it was designed for PvP being technical combat, now its lack luster.\r\n\r\nIs this a good game to kill time with? sure, is it worth any of the hype around the combat or endgame? No as the combat was recently gutted and end game is non existent unless you like to afk in towns or spam Out Post Rush with a majority of firestaff and musket players. \r\n\r\nWill many stick around due to this games end game or combat?

Ne vous étonnez donc pas si vous me trouvez exigeant voir excessif.\r\n\r\nAlors voilà j'ai pas mal d'heures sur New World comme vous pouvez le constater. Force est de constater que le jeu est très beau et fluide également. Bref il est nickel sans demander une configuration de malade.\r\n\r\nJe commence par la création du personnage. Elle est assez simpliste contrairement peut être à TESO certes. On se sent néanmoins un peu limité en terme de Gabaris voire dans l'âge de votre personnage. Par contre pas mal de tronches sont originales :).\r\n\r\nOn arrive donc au jeu proprement dit. Vous avez droit a une petite intro d'initiation sympa également.\r\n\r\nL'originalité de ce jeu est qu'il n'y pas de classes proprement dites. C'est vous qui définissez vos capacités avec le développement de vos armes et la gestion de vos points de compétences.\r\n\r\nC'est pas trop mal, en gros vous pouvez choisir un peu de résistance en boostant vos PV au détriment d'autre chose certes mais à vous de voir. Le seul point un peu négatif à ce système peut être est que le développement d'une statistique (par exemple la force), aurait pu peut être offrir des choix à effectuer malgré tout. On a le sentiment d'une grande linéarité hélas. Facile à dire certes j'en conviens. Ce système se rapproche un peu de celui de Guild Wars I en tout cas :).\r\n\r\nLa grosse originalité de votre personnage vient alors du fait que contrairement à la plupart des MMORPG, donc Guild Wars bien sûr, vous devez connaître un maximum de passifs et peu de compétences actives.\r\nMaîtriser vos choix en terme de développement d'armes revient donc à bien connaître ses passifs dans un premier temps (oui je sais TESO le fait aussi). Les compétences actives ont en revanche de longs cooldown : il faut donc les utiliser avec parcimonie. Why not après tout? cela change des jeux ou ils faut spammer comme un malade ses touches.\r\n\r\nBravo donc. En revanche je tenais à dire que toutes les statistiques n'offrent pas le même volume d'armes et que certains manques existent depuis le début. Eh oui, si vous jouer la caractéristique du soin par exemple, il vous sera difficile de'avoir le choix avec une autre arme réellement sauf celle en dégâts du vide ce qui est paradoxale un peu pour un soigneur. Ceci alors qu'il manque certaines compétences de protection pour votre groupe d'une part, et de gestion de dps également d'autre part. Ne vous étonnez pas de crever si vous péter votre aggro en levelling. Ne vous étonnez pas de mettre un temps fou à tuer des mobs. Certes c'est le levelling et le farming mais ça compte pas mal dans ce jeu. Un bâton de protection avec un léger support de soin ou un bâton de combat aurait pu compléter cette situation par exemple.\r\n\r\nVoilà en ce qui concerne le personnage! Passons au contenu maintenant.\r\n\r\nEn terme de taille du monde je dirais que trop de cartes sont axées sur le leveling. Une fois fait vous aurez peu de zones HL hélas. Peut être qu'on en a pas besoin d'une multitude certes. Néanmoins TESO gère cette contrainte très bien certes. Peut être que les dévs ont également quelques idées à ce sujet mais bon ...\r\n\r\nEn terme de de métiers un nerf appréciable a été fait. Avant il vous fallait une éternité et des trains entiers de ressources pour up. Je souligne que c'était peut être la volonté de départ des devs d'atteindre les plus hauts niveaux difficilement accessibles ce qui n'est pas en soit une mauvaise chose pour rallonger la durée de vie de leur jeu. C'était un risque commercial peut être à revoir dans sa conception certes. D'où le nerf actuel. Mais j'apprécie l'originalité une fois encore.\r\n\r\nCôté JcE, le jeu était très pauvre au départ car l'orientation JcJ devait dominer le jeu.  Encore une fois ce fût un choix risqué. En effet beaucoup de joueurs aiment profiter d'une initialisation à leur rythme, jouer pépère dans leur coin ou avec des potes aussi. Quelques zone instancées ont donc enrichie un peu le jeu.\r\n\r\nOn arrive au JcJ le coeur du jeu. Vous pouvez décider ou pas d'activer le JcJ sauvage et ça c'est une bonne chose. Quoiqu'il aurait pu être obligatoire dans certaines zones HL why not ... Cela n'a pas été abordé. Passons aux arènes (les déferlantes). Sympa comme dab dans tous les MMORPG. PAr contre le système central qui consiste à conquérir des territoires est nul de chez nul. Grosso modo vous arrivez sur un champ de bataille à résurrection infinie. Le champ de bataille lui même étant pas ouf. C'est une bataille rangée entre deux groupes. Je résume sec et comme tous les jeux JcJ actuels... c'est hors classement donc les débutants n'ont malheureusement aucune chance. Peut être aurait il mieux valu créer des serveurs en fonction du niveau JcJ qu'en fonction des pays. Facile à dire encore une fois j'en convient. Mais ne vous étonnez pas de voir du frenchy sur de l'anglais sur le canal de discussion à la base... Sans compter que le nombre de territoires est limité et donc que donc peu de guildes peuvent posséder.\r\n\r\nQuand à la guilde sa création est simpliste et les modes de recherches très limités en terme de paramètres voir inexistants. Petite déception de ce côté là.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion : J'ai été long mais exaustif du moins je l'espère.\r\nNew World offre pas mal de bonnes choses, certaines originales aussi. Par contre il faut reconnaître que ces tentatives se sont heurtées à un public qui est justement varié comme toujours. Le coeur même du jeu étant lui même confronté à ce problème. Le nombre de serveurs à donc littéralement fondu depuis le départ reflétant ainsi la baisse du nombre de joueurs présents. J'ai cependant mis une note positive car c'est peut être le meilleur MMORPG du marché actuellement malgré ses carences & défauts.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1739858112, "timestamp_updated": 1739858112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663103163242340088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Безусловно, с точки зрения лора игры и его геймплейных элементов, проект действительно весьма уникальный и на первый взгляд вполне успешен. Однако стоит копнуть чуть глубже и заглянуть, так скажем, под капот, и можно узреть крайне малоприятную картину. \n[h3]Было? Стало?[/h3]\nКогда игра только вышла в ней были просто тонны проблем с оптимизацией. Постоянные лаги, баги, зависания анимаций, потерянные текстуры, дисконнекты и вылеты... это только верхушка айсберга. Но стало ли сейчас лучше? Нет! Буквально перед выходом [b]Rise of the Angry Earth[/b] игру более или менее привели в играбельное состояние. Но как только вышло дополнение, всё полетело в тартарары и старые баги вернулись прихватив с собой парочку товарищей... Игра в плачевном состоянии, даже сейчас, почти 4 года после релиза, что достаточно прискорбно и непростительно для разработчика уровня [b]Amazon[/b] Более того, скажу что после обновления New World до издания [b]Aeternum[/b], хранить игру на HDD просто невозможно. Только накопитель формата SSD или рискуете по десять раз пытаться зайти в игру (и не факт что получится)... \n\n[i]Небольшое отступление по поводу цены. Ценник на дополнение ещё тогда вызвал немалые споры и достаточно бурный шквал критики, потому что никому не хотелось превращения игры в [b]TESO[/b] когда есть неповторимый оригинал. Сейчас же я очень хочу верить что такая цена на игру обусловлена её выходом на [b]Play Station[/b] и [b]Xbox[/b]. Однако за такой прайс вы вполне можете найти и более достойные проекты, которые принесут вам куда больше удовольствия, и самое главное, меньше головной боли...[/i]\n[h3]Gameplay или \"Я до сих пор не понимаю эту игру\"[/h3]\nИграешь за ДД, приятно фармить мобов и в целом есть возможность вносить много урона, но есть нюанс. В пати тебя не берут, так-как таких вот \"ДД\" в игре полно и всех оценивают по шмоту. Так-что если вы хотите собрать нормальную экипировку, можете рассчитывать только на случайное пати и закрывать подземелья с переменным успехом. К тому же, на всяких Outpost Rush`ах сколько бы вы не вливали урона в противника, если у них в групе есть всего парочка хилеров, для них ваша уберпалка 625го GSа просто зубочистка. Запасы маны у магов здесь просто условность. Настолько что даже банки восстановления маны в этой игре бесполезный мусор... Хотите играть за танка? Без проблем, вы можете создать булыжник который с трудом сможет расколоть разве что десять человек все вместе, но... но есть нюанс. Ваш урон будет настолько мизерным, что фармить каких либо мобов без чьей либо помощи станет просто невозможно... Вы конечно можете собрать себе второй сет, и перекидывать атрибуты по ситуации, но какой в этом смысл если на том же Outpost Rush`е вас с одного выстрела мушкета уделает какой нибудь читер. Лично я, как-бы не одевался в этой игре, никогда не чувствовал что у меня есть хоть какое-то преимущество. Если ты танк, у тебя нет нормального уворота и тебя запинают толпой или с расстояния. Если хил или ДД, то против тебя всегда найдется какой нибудь перс который просто не выпустит тебя со стана... Возможно это я такой криворукий и просто не смог осилить эту игру, что всеми силами ватной анимации старается походить на [u]соулс[/u]. Но как по мне, даже игры серии Souls куда понятнее и проще для восприятия чем это детище от [b]Amazon[/b]...\n\n[i]Рекомендую ли я эту игру? Однозначно нет! Пожалейте своё время и нервы, есть игры которые больше заслуживают на ваши кровные, приберегите их лучше для них... у меня всё.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1739846486, "timestamp_updated": 1739858466, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758538484573364258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

While it's easy to understand why some players might harbor frustrations due to its rough past, the direction the game is heading in gives me hope. The future feels bright, and I’m optimistic about the updates and changes promised by the developers.\nOne of my favorite aspects is the skill progression system. It's something that OSRS players can easily relate to, and it brings a sense of nostalgia while introducing some fresh concepts. Just like in OSRS, the game offers a chance to chill and grind skills at your own pace. Whether it's the peaceful and meditative act of cutting trees or mining ore, or the more intense action involved in expeditions and special in-game events, there's something for every type of player. You can choose how involved you want to get, making it incredibly accessible to all types of players.\nPvP, though somewhat minimal at the moment, is another element I keep an eye on. While the current PvP offerings aren't as extensive as some might like, the game has shown a clear focus on improving this aspect with upcoming updates. For players who enjoy the thrill of combat and competition, these upcoming changes could offer a lot more depth and excitement.\nIt’s always been my belief that this game has potential for a thriving player base, if only more people gave it a chance. The world feels alive with possibilities—though I’ll admit, it’s hard not to imagine what it would be like if the cities were as bustling as they were a few years ago. Still, the community is welcoming, and there's always the promise of new things to come, with future plans looking solid.\nWhile the game has certainly had its struggles, its future prospects give me hope. For anyone who enjoys the journey of skill progression, the balance of casual and intense gameplay, and the potential of the game's future updates—PvP included—I’d highly recommend giving it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1739716701, "timestamp_updated": 1739716701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538461565971374512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Jedoch nach dam Technischen Desaster den Amazon hin gelegt hatte und diverse Game-breaking bugs gekonnt ignoriert wurden, sind natürlich die Spielerzahlen gedroppt. Auch der endgame content war nicht so gut. Klar Pvpler, wie ich einer bin, sind auf ihre kosten gekommen, solange man Gegner hatte.\r\n\r\nDie Erweiterung mit der Wüste (weis nicht mehr wie sie dieses Update nannten) war was neues. Zwar immer noch die alten Mechaniken, aber man konnte zumindest was tolles sehen.\r\n\r\nMit \"Aeternum\" haben sie ein spiel raus gebracht wie es hätte von Anfang an sein sollen. Das hätte wirklich Impact gehabt in der MMO-Welt, nur war es da schon zu spät. Die Spielerzahlen sind zwar noch akzeptabel aber bei weitem nicht so wie sie hätten sein sollen, auch wenn sie es nun als Action RPG mit MMO Elementen  neu Branden wollen, wird es halt noch als MMO angesehen. \r\n\r\nWas mich am meisten stört ist das DLC \"Rise of the Angry Earth\" da zeigt Amazon mal wieder was dene am wichtigsten ist, GELD. Natürlich verstehe ich das auch Amazon mit dem Spiel Geld verdienen will. Aber Spielmechaniken hinter eine Pay-Wall stellen?! Wirklich gerade das Mount System, was hätte im Basisspiel sein sollen, hätten sie frei geben können. Diverse neue Fähigkeiten hinter ner Pay-Wall stellen... kann ich noch akzeptieren.

They recently introduced a PVP server. forced flag at level 15. - People are complaining that they are getting farmed by level 65's. Yet do the same thing when they hit 65. if you're being griefed just go somewhere else. chopping wood can get you to 65 very quickly. The player base begged for the PVP based game to incorporate it more and when they got it, they still found everything to complain about.\n\n2. The devs have an active roadmap addressing a lot of requests. The game doesnt have a monthly subscription. that in itself is amazing, The player base here is very wishy washy. they want more more more. When in reality this game is absolutely a masterpiece in the making. the story, the graphics, the immersive open world.. the pvp.. its all wonderful. There is nothing else out there that has the same feel as this game.. hence the players on here writing horrid reviews yet still clocking 10+ hours a day.\n\n3. THE GAME IS GREAT! THE GRAPHICS, THE PVP, EVERYTHING IS WONDERFUL. IT'S 2025 AND WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE NOBODY IS EVER HAPPY WITH ANYTHING. IF YOU WANT A FUN MMORPG THAT YOU CAN PVP YOUR BOOTY OFF AND LOOT TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT..THEN JUST PLAY THE DAMN GAME.  ITS FUN.. REALLY FUN.. THEY ARE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS..

Prospective players would likely see their money wasted on a game bound to a slow death should development not take a fundamentally different direction on the way they approach maintaining, and adding to their product.\n\n\nCOMBAT: Most players relate the combat To Dark souls games. Dodging/Blocking is essential for late game activities. A light medium or heavy armor rating either improves suitability at a severe cost to damage, or increase damage significantly at the cost of survivability, or something in between with medium. There are currently 15 weapon types, each with a Skills tree with 6 abilities to choose from, only being able to have 3 active to use for each weapon.\n\nLEVELING: The new player experience is mediocre despite being improved from launch, adding more cinematic, and voiced dialogue. The leveling experience is usually enjoyed right up to about level 45/65, Where things start slowing down. When you get to max level, You will likely find yourself in a weird position where you still have about 10 hours of Main story quests you have to do to fully unlock everything you need to do (brimstone quests and elysian Wilds). The rewards of doing these quests aside from heart-runes, is not comparable to what you can get from chest runs, and dungeons, leaving it to feel like \"Busy work\".\n\nCRAFTING: Trade skills range from level 1-250 and require refining and gathering skills to craft gear, or consumables. Crafting starts out extremely rewarding. using the items you've gathered in the world from chests and gatherables, you can craft fine tuned armor at an early level that will be far better than any dungeon or quest while also getting good experience. This changes around level 35 items, as you start requiring so many resources to craft just one item that it is far more efficient to level up by doing dungeons, and use the gear from that instead. New world requires the previous tier resource to craft the next one. with there being around 5-6 tiers of gatherables, it can require a mountain of the most basic resource to craft one tier 6 resource. for example, It requires about 20,000 Stone (Tier 1) to craft 1 Prismatic block (Tier 6). You get about 20-30 stone per rock you mine, with each node taking about 4-5 seconds to mine.\n\nENDGAME: End game is difficult for new players in the sense that many resources/gear that you need to progress to the next level of content is either timekept by the game, or gate kept by the community. Timekeeping in new world consists of items that are needed to upgrade good gear to the highest Gear score they can be can only be purchased one per day. You need 3 to upgrade one item which means it requires a new player 30,000 Gold (players get about 5-6k per day if they run the minimal amount of dailies) and a minimum of 3 days in order to upgrade ONE armor piece. veteran communities largely dont like to run endgame content, but farm it. they want groups that already have the best possible gear in the game to run the raids that drop the best gear in the game. This has been a problem of the community since new worlds conception, With Groups requiring an Average 625 gear score to run the only dungeon that drops 625 gear score items back during launch for example. As a veteran player that already have the necessary items to be \"christened\" for Raid runs, it is not a problem for me, but is a problem for newer players that i wouldn't wish upon anyone trying to just casually enjoy a video game.\n\nPVP: New world has a ridiculous skill ceiling for pvp. some of the best items in the game are locked behind a PVP level experience. Players have to have a minimum of 30 hours of PVP in order to start getting some of the Best PVE items in the game. Yes you have spend Copious amounts of time in PVP to get PVE items.\n\nSUPPORT: This is my largest Criticism of new world. Amazon Game Studios (AGS) has grossly failed to provide support or updates for their game in an efficient manner. AGS mostly releases new \"Content\" and bug fixes once per business quarter (3 months). The first month most player have already digested what new content there was, leaving 2 months of virtually nothing entertaining to do in a game. Even worse, New content may be bugged, or exploitable. Rather than fixing it on the spot, AGS normally doesnt fix it until next update cycle (3 months) or if it is really bad, will disable the content for 3 months. No matter the Developer, Bug fixes should be dished out weekly, or at worst, monthly. Items or content shouldnt be disabled for months. There are smaller indie developers that are providing more content, and support than AGS by a long shot. demands from the community that are practically unanimous are not seriously considered. Since launch, the communities have demanded mounts to reduce boring travel. it took AGS 2 Years to implement mounts into the game. This has grown the veteran community that still believes in the game to grow bitter and foul in temperament towards development and other players, and is understandable.\n\nWHAT I THINK NEEDS TO CHANGE: \nNEW WEAPONS\nWEAPON BALANCE (Make all weapons viable in moderation to a group composition)\nWEEKLY BUG FIXES\nMONTHLY UPDATES\nEXPANSION EVERY YEAR (Not a \"Re Release\")\nCHANGE PVP TRACK TO A PVP SHOP (Allow player to purchase items they want once a certain pvp level has been reached)\nMAKE PVP ARTIFACTS THAT HAVE PVP ONLY UNIQUE PERKS. (PVE players shouldnt be forced to grind PVP for hundreds of hours to get a BIS Items for PVE)\nMAKE HATCH/FORGE RAIDS 710 GS ITEMS TO GIVE NEW PLAYERS BETTER GEAR FOR THEIR FIRST HIVE RUN\nSIMPLIFY REFINING (Either eliminate need for Refining Reagents, or remove intermittent refining resources like steel, rugged leather, and sateen)\nSIMPLIFY CRAFTING (Less requisites to make 700GS items. Have options for 725 GS crafting aside from raiding schematics)\n\nCONCLUSION: New world has a great foundation in a corrosive environment. AGS laid out the groundwork for an amazing game, but have left it to slowly rot away to the point that it has lost 98% of its player base (Peak concurrent 900,000. Now is 9,000-10,000). AGS needs to pull a 180 in their vision for the game, or sell the rights to somebody who will if they hope to restore faith in the player base or for more players to invest in the game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1739120822, "timestamp_updated": 1739120822, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

They recently came out with season 7 which forces open world pvp after level 15. And while that can sound intimidating for people who aren't big on pvp, Imo pvp is what separates this game from the rest. It forces you to interact and mingle with other players, which makes it feel like an actual mmo. Without open world pvp the game is just another single player hack and slash rpg lite, gathering sim with a Morbius tier main story that takes forever. \n\nGathering is more risky but rewarding. Somebody else taking your farm? Wipe them out. Bots are somewhat reduced because it legit is a slaughter fest out there. People are more social on the pvp server too. Wow classic forces you to engage with other players by making the over all pve content difficult.

Since these two are my personal favorite games, a combination of both is surreal.\nExcellent colorful, realistic looking forests and environments. Combat system looks real and not overly flashy with lights or sound. Accurate dodging and targeting system, both for free-ranged shooting or target lock. Armor system allows you to choose heavier armor for defensive benefits, or lighter armor for offensive benefits. Three dimensional landscape with hills, towers, castles and valleys with many rocks or walls that are climbable. Suited for Solo play early game or group play in end game. Multiple quests that guide adventures and a developed crafting system that aids the ability of players to sell their crafted goods or loot discovered.\n\nThe only thing that could be added or that I haven't discovered yet is scaled leveling to allow anyone to join any group quest or raid.\nAlso, to aid players to form groups - an added tool that allows players to see the names of others who are on the same quests to join them for completion. This would be exceptional if there were several lower level questlines that required groups to take down bosses as the final sequence of a questline tailored to their preferred class.\nA single pet bot that fills a specific role (healing, ranged dps, tanking) could be helpful in early levels to help players learn how to be good at their role in a group. These pet bots could be banshed when entering a group only instanced scenario.\n\nImproving crafting: adding specific items that can only be crafted, but that strengthens healing,  defense or offense incredibly - benefits only available while in a group or raid. These added crafted effects or items could not only aid in these performance areas, but could change the look of the player when the effect is in force: i.e. - the tank gets larger, the healer glows with white light, the wizard burns or is surrounded with ice, and the rogue or archer is cast in moving shadows. This would help in locating specific individuals in the chaos of a large raid.\nA side note: I don't know if the developers will actually read this, but hey great job.

Both of these things are true in many ways. This game is broken more often than it's working, sometimes in little ways, sometimes in game-breaking ways. It can be a frustrating game in that regard.\nThat being said, the leveling experience in this game was the best I have experienced in any game of this kind. It has the usual \"go here, get/kill thing, come back\" quests, but this game's world is truly a treat to walk through and explore.\nMy real bread and butter, though, is the skilling. Oh my god, the skilling. I'm an on and off OSRS player, so skilling is kind of my thing, and this game feels like the modern iteration of that. The crafting and collecting skills tie together so well, and watching the numbers go up is so satisfying. That, coupled with the absolutely S-tier sound design in this game makes leveling the best part of the game, for me.\nSome people love the combat in this game, I think it absolutely blows. It just isn't good or deep, and feels jank. At least in PvE, it kind of just comes down to who's number is bigger. Spam left click, use abilities when they recharge, repeat. There's a bit more too it than that, but I really don't think that it's anything to write home about.\nI have reached the endgame, but it just wasn't for me. I found more fun in making another character and starting over from the beginning, rather than playing the endgame. It relies a lot of PvE content that I just don't find fun, as I said before.\nI would not get this game at full price, especially if you're on the fence.

So not only did I lose access to a game I PAID FOR, but I was punished for Amazon’s own security failures.\n\nAmazon’s refusal to properly investigate or assist legitimate players is disgusting. If they actually cared about their customers, they would have better security measures and a support team that does more than copy-paste responses.

If you’ve been keeping up with New World or any of their games, you know the struggle. The patches, the hot fixes, the constant broken systems — and yet, they NEVER take responsibility. You would think after multiple issues and glaring bugs, they’d finally acknowledge their mistakes, but nope.\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the most basic problem: Patches that induce 'Exploits'. Time and time again, AGS releases a patch, and what do we get in return? New exploits or bugs and more bugs. \r\nEvery single time! Instead of fixing what’s broken, they seem to just move the problem around. I'd dare say some of the bugs are critical components to the game, and what do we get from AGS? Crickets. No apologies, no official statements, just a lack of accountability. It’s like they don’t even care that players are not getting the service the paid for months on end.\r\n\r\nWe’re talking about game-breaking bugs that affect the economy, PvP, and overall player experience. People exploit bugs, make tons of money, wreck the economy, and then AGS just... Banns everyone and moves on, like they haven’t just let their community down again. The worst part? They never admit their failures. They just slap on a quick hotfix (Which creates more bugs), hope players forget, and then repeat the cycle.\r\n\r\nHow can a dev team be so out of touch with their player base? They push changes without proper testing, let known issues persist for far too long (Elemental Band and many known faults), and completely miss the mark on what players actually want. I mean, the game is riddled with performance issues, glitches, and bad balancing (Artifacts that have no purpose), and we’re all expected to sit back and pretend everything is fine?\r\n\r\nIt’s honestly embarrassing. AGS should stop pointing fingers elsewhere and start owning up to their mistakes. How hard is it to admit that you screwed up and actually fix things in a meaningful way instead of doing the same patch-and-pray nonsense? Until they take real responsibility and prioritize fixing the actual game, they’ll remain the gold standard for how not to handle game development.\r\n\r\nAGS, do better.

Though really not sure why Devs allowed original players with a purchased base game to allow their characters to stay in the  rezoned dlc areas, should have relocated characters to the nearest base game area or town...or maybe bug.\n\nSo in short after playing for a few days i have enjoyed the game to level 25 and while some things are a bit quirky or need attention as a casual player its entertaining.  Thus i changed my review to Yes recommend. I cant comment for mid or endgame content but so far its been fun. Not sure if i will buy the angry earth dlc at this stage but lets see over the next few weeks/months if i still enjoy it. The AP server is quiet  and Trade/market has limited materials for sale, but as a solo player will explore and make do for now. Thx\n\n\n\nIts hard to write review when i can't access the game! I purchased the base game over a year ago and after the updates and better reviews i decided to try again. After downloading the 70gig update files overnight  i go to start the game and comes up with message saying player locked, i need to pay A$46.99 for the DLC expansion to continue..WTF seriously i purchased the game and now cant play unless i pay more. Seriously online games suck..i expect some updates you may have to pay for but not being able to play the base game . I need to support hard copies again ! or just play older games. No surprise many devs and studios collapse after a few years with no access to online game you paid for. Where is player focus or loyalty to games they make, its just money money money. What happened to all the real developers with ethics and making games for the luv of it while making a little cash, no obscene incomes and producing alpha/beta games and release them only to have redos over several years then they collapse and you have no access to the game you payed for and hours lost you put into the game... rant over thx for reading :-)\n\nOK update - FYI if you start a new character in one of your available slots then the base game starts up ok and you can start playing. So i guess the original locked character maybe in one of the changed zones that requires dlc  to play. Anyway will play for a while and see what changes have occured.  cheers", "timestamp_created": 1738277967, "timestamp_updated": 1738667451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

The graphics and combat are mainly what have kept me coming back. No other MMO in my opinion has combat like this. That being said, they have made some major changes to the game so that they could re release it on consoles as a \"new game.\" I was happy to have console players added to the very small player population. \r\n\r\nBecause this was just a cash grab by AGS they didn't actually do anything to change the game. They just added target locking to help controller players, but they allowed target locking for all players. The once fun and challenging PVP aspect of the game has now become a trivial tab target button masher and whoever has the best gear wins. \r\n\r\nNot only was this a major change that made the game not fun anymore, they also decided to introduce seasonal pvp servers. This would be a great idea if this game actually had the player base of any mainstream MMO, but it doesn't. So now the player base is so divided that all of the servers feel empty. \r\n\r\nThe economy is completely broken because of the lack of players and on top of that they introduced yet another game breaking weapon along with a change to healing so that this weapon is EVEN MORE game breaking. Yes I'm talking about the \"Burnanator\" firestaff. It's super easy to get and super easy to make a dominant pvp build with it. The problem is that I don't want to play firestaff in pvp, but I'm already at a big disadvantage playing anything else. How is that supposed to be fun? This game is filled with fun to play weapons and builds, but they aren't viable against someone playing with a broken \"meta\" build. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, this was once one of my favorite games and instead of fixing the endless bugs that have plagued this game since day 1 PC release, they continue to update it with things no one asked for, introduce new game breaking bugs, and overall just make the game not very fun to play anymore. \r\n\r\nI'm sad to be saying goodbye to this game.

I don't think they are dead like some people constantly claim, but at times it does feel like the players are spread a little thin.

I think its a great idea in theory, or if the game had more players but it does just spread out the remaining player base.\n\nAnother thing is that I feel the devs are sometimes a little slow to actually nerf or buff things that need it. That doesn't mean it's impossible to play normal PvP or anything, but rather you will just end up running into irritation a little more frequently.\n\nDeep down I think the devs actually do love this game, and like everyone that is still playing it we want them to have a big win.

The game had so much promise. The combat is player controlled vs combat like WoW where it's a race to mash the most buttons. The diversity in weapons was cool and I enjoyed the PvE and PvP combat. The Companies was a great idea with being able to conquer territory through PvP events, declaring war on other factions, and setting taxes and fees on crafting and refining to fund the Companies. I thoroughly enjoyed that. It gave the Companies purpose instead of just being a purely cosmetic social hub like most other MMO's, even if it makes it easier to group for raids and dungeons.\n\nThe main story was alright at first, then they introduced a more in-depth campaign with more cutscenes and cinematics to drive the narrative and make it more immersive. I thought that was a good improvement. I also thought more waypoints to fast travel was a good quality of life update.\n\nThe crafting system is one I like. I've dropped this game and picked up primarily for the aesthetic of the PvE and the crafting. It hits the spot in ways other MMO's don't. They made some updates to where you don't really have professions that fall behind. Wood gathering was one that started off the most annoying as it was the slowest grind. You could deforest a whole zone and it would only give maybe half a dozen levels. Meanwhile, your other gathering skills are double, if not triple, that of wood gathering.\n\nWhat became an obvious faltering point was endgame content. It was severely lacking. There were the two high-level zones, but there wasn't much to do other than the respective dungeons and grind for the mats to craft legendary gear that didn't really mean much since it wasn't necessary to grind in the high-level zones. Eventually, there was more content added, but endgame content being overlooked like that is something that can kill a game as it's supposed to make a difference on how the entire leveling process and playstyle is conducted, whether it be PvE or PvP.\n\nThe part that makes me dislike the game is the fact that the devs blocked off First Light, then paywalled it as a \"DLC\", throwing in a mount and new weapon. Even though it's only one zone, the devs have orchestrated it to where OG players had to buy it twice. I have yet to do so and a mount and new weapon isn't enough to entice me to buy that zone a second time. I paid for it once when I bought the game. I'm not buying it again.\n\nWhat shows that this game isn't doing as well as AGS likes to believe is that they've had to do numerous server merges as there haven't been enough players to justify the number of servers they first had. To go from what many called \"queue simulator\" because the servers were bloated to multiple consolidations shows just how far the game fell. Then they rereleased the game when they made it available for consoles, adding a subtitle like it made a difference. All it did was wipe the mixed reviews from the first iteration. Rather than permitting the deception, the players carried the reviews over as to maintain honesty.\n\nDespite the features, mechanics, and concepts that I like, I do not recommend this game. What I personally enjoy isn't enough to endorse the game in its entirety. I'd be doing a disservice to the developers by saying this game is worth spending money on in its current state. We need better quality games, not rebranded mediocrity. I'll probably play it in small increments, but other MMO's scratch the overall MMO itch better than New World ever will at this point. It's a shame. This game had so much potential. I foresee that unless a massive expansion with a rework or a sequel comes out that addresses and fixes what went wrong with this game, it won't be long before they're forced to stop supporting it. With only a handful of servers left, it's seems like an inevitability.", "timestamp_created": 1737832649, "timestamp_updated": 1737832649, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Die detailreichen Wälder, dichten Nebelschwaden und das stimmige Lichtspiel sorgen für eine der immersivsten Welten in einem MMO. Das Gefühl, durch dschungelartige Ruinen oder schneebedeckte Berge zu streifen, ist unvergleichlich.\n\n[b]Gameplay: [/b]\nDas actionorientierte Kampfsystem bietet ein angenehmes Gefühl, aber die geringe Anzahl an Fähigkeiten pro Waffe begrenzt die taktische Tiefe. Das Handwerkssystem ist umfangreich, aber der Grind – insbesondere bei Rohstoffen höherer Stufen – kann schnell monoton werden.\n\n[b]PvP und Kriege:[/b] \nDie Massenschlachten um Territorien sind ein Highlight, allerdings von Performance-Problemen und unzureichendem Balancing geplagt. Die Dominanz größerer Gilden schränkt kleinere Spielergruppen oft ein.\n\n[b]Endgame:[/b] \nHier liegt das größte Problem: Nach Level 60 fehlt es an motivierenden Inhalten. Die Dungeon-Mechaniken sind interessant, aber der Fokus auf Grinding und sich wiederholende Expeditionen fühlt sich uninspiriert an.\n\n[b]Mein Fazit:[/b] \nNew World ist eine visuell beeindruckende Reise in eine einzigartige Welt, die jedoch unter wiederholenden Inhalten, unausgereiftem Endgame, schlechtem Balancing und technischen Schwächen leidet. Es bietet starke Momente – vor allem in der Erkundung und im PvP – verliert jedoch schnell an Reiz, wenn die anfängliche Faszination der Welt verblasst.Es ist ein Erlebnis, das eher visuell als spielerisch glänzt.", "timestamp_created": 1737818391, "timestamp_updated": 1737818391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

I enjoyed the game enough to shill 30 dollars to ride a mount that wasnt announced as a free dlc initially, AND was just a rumor that was circulating around when the game came out. I've spent a solid week, or so, reading reviews on the store page wondering if the game turned to rubbish in the time that I was away, and have observed that the game itself hasnt really changed aside from a lockon mechanic causing issues with some of the players complaining about muskets. My response to those complaints, is if its a big issue for you go play call of duty with a controller then log back in.... \n\nAny other review past a bug complaint or \"lame cash grab scheme making us pay for mounts when newbies get it for free\", is complete sillyness, if you had any brain, you would remember that originally the game (when it came out) was around 30-40 dollars. You'd have to be a complete moron to not notice that the base game has now changed from that price to now the whopping $60. Im willing to pay another 30 for new shit and a mount considering that would put me, what, just ten more dollars above the now $60?\n\nI understand the distrust of the community towards the dev team, for the dev teams lack of responsibility, and/or, respect to their own players, and can see how that would turn a lot of players away. But for a 'lone wolf' player I find myself playing as, I never really tried reporting issues, or running to mommy or daddy when a bug would cause me issues in game. That is, unfortunately, how I went about any, and all, games that i've ever played, and i find that i enjoy a game a WHOLE lot more when I dont have to worry about whether a bug I hate is going to be fixed soon or thinking that I will write a strongly worded paragraph on why I think he/she is hacking in this instance. Regardless if the dev team is doing their jobs, correctly or at all, its not mine.

The environment is truly beautiful, and the music is also great. The immersion is there. Player housing is a cool part of the game as well. Combat is fun, modern and satisfying. Being able to swap your \"class\" by changing your weapon is awesome. Dungeon design and boss fights are truly incredible. Mutated dungeons are no joke, but the rewards are worth it. The story is decent enough to keep you interested, but it could be better. I skipped most dialogs but I enjoyed the cutscenes alot. Gearing up, finding upgrades and working on your artifacts and BiS is a fun process. The season pass is also fun to complete, with the \"bingo card\" mechanic. PvP is fine, but I'm bad at it so I can't really comment.\n\nOf course, the game is not perfect.

Graphismes et direction artistique\nNew World: Aeternum propose des graphismes époustouflants qui exploitent pleinement les capacités des machines modernes. Les environnements sont détaillés et immersifs, avec des effets de lumière et d’ombres particulièrement impressionnants. Les paysages de l’île d’Aeternum sont variés, allant des forêts luxuriantes aux montagnes enneigées en passant par des ruines mystérieuses. Cependant, ce niveau de détail a un prix : sur un PC gaming datant de 10 ans, le jeu est tout simplement injouable, même avec les paramètres graphiques au minimum.\n\n2. Gameplay et mécanique de jeu\nLe gameplay de New World se concentre sur un mélange d’exploration, de combat en temps réel et d’artisanat. Le système de combat, qui repose sur des compétences actives et une gestion précise des esquives et des attaques, est à la fois dynamique et satisfaisant. Les joueurs peuvent choisir parmi une variété de styles de jeu grâce à des armes comme les épées, les arcs et les bâtons magiques.\n\nL’artisanat est particulièrement bien développé, avec un système complexe qui récompense la collecte et la création d’équipements. Les factions et les batailles de territoire ajoutent une dimension compétitive et sociale intéressante. Toutefois, la répétitivité des quêtes et le grind nécessaire pour progresser peuvent devenir lassants à la longue.\n\n3. Histoire et narration\nLe jeu propose une intrigue centrée sur l’île mystérieuse d’Aeternum, où des forces surnaturelles et des secrets anciens attendent d’être découverts. Bien que l’histoire principale offre quelques moments captivants, elle manque parfois de profondeur et de personnages marquants. Les quêtes secondaires sont souvent génériques, se limitant à des tâches classiques comme éliminer des ennemis ou collecter des objets.\n\n4. Bande-son et ambiance sonore\nLa bande-son de New World est immersive, avec des compositions orchestrales qui renforcent l’ambiance mystérieuse et épique d’Aeternum. Les bruitages environnementaux, comme le vent dans les arbres ou le cliquetis des armes, contribuent à l’immersion. Cependant, le doublage des personnages est minimal, ce qui peut diminuer l’impact narratif pour certains joueurs.\n\n5. Durée de vie et rejouabilité\nNew World offre une durée de vie impressionnante, grâce à son monde ouvert vaste et à ses activités variées, comme l’artisanat, les batailles de territoire et les expéditions. Les joueurs investis dans les aspects multijoueurs, comme les guerres entre factions ou le commerce, trouveront beaucoup de raisons de rester engagés. Cependant, pour les joueurs plus occasionnels, la nature répétitive du contenu pourrait limiter l’attrait à long terme.\n\n6. Points positifs\nGraphismes magnifiques et direction artistique immersive.\nSystème de combat dynamique et satisfaisant.\nArtisanat et économie bien développés.\nBatailles de territoire compétitives et engageantes.\n\n7. Points négatifs\nRequiert un PC puissant : injouable sur une machine datant de 10 ans.\nQuêtes répétitives et grind intensif.\nHistoire principale et personnages manquant de profondeur.\nDifficulté à équilibrer les factions, ce qui peut frustrer les joueurs.\n\nConclusion\nNew World: Aeternum est un MMORPG ambitieux qui brille par ses graphismes impressionnants, son gameplay dynamique et ses nombreuses activités sociales et compétitives. Cependant, ses exigences matérielles élevées le rendent inaccessible pour les joueurs disposant d’un PC plus ancien, et sa répétitivité pourrait décourager certains.

On the one hand, it showcases some of the most impressive technical achievements in the MMO genre. Its engine is nothing short of outstanding, delivering breathtaking visuals, seamless landscapes, and immersive environments. The combat system, without a doubt, is the best I've ever experienced—fluid, engaging, and brimming with potential to redefine action-based MMO gameplay.\nBut here's the kicker: the brilliance of New World is being systematically sabotaged by its own leadership, particularly Game Director Scot Lane. This man seems utterly clueless about what he's doing. For years, the community has been voicing the same issues and offering clear feedback. And what does Scot do? He insists he knows better, leading the game deeper into a quagmire of poor decisions.\nLet’s talk specifics:\n1.\tPvP Content: There’s only one Outpost Rush (OPR) map and two arena maps—and it’s been like this for years. The matchmaking for PvP modes is horrible you wait way to long for a quick match with randoms. There should be a FFA mode or Team Deathmatch etc.\n2.\tStory Mode: The story has been reworked multiple times, leaving players to slog through revamped content that lacks coherence or excitement. The recent 40GB update is the worst offender yet, introducing a disastrous PvP server concept that defies logic and alienates the community.\n3.\tIncompetence on Display: Upon the release of the latest update (21.01.25), players were logging out in droves right after completing the tutorial. Why? Because no one wants to relive the same rehashed story year after year. Scot Lane’s grand vision for New World is complete garbage—an absolute train wreck of wasted potential.\nThe community is unanimously disappointed. No one I know has anything positive to say about the developers, and this speaks volumes about the leadership. New World could have been the perfect MMO, but under Scot Lane’s direction, it’s spiraling toward its grave.\nAmazon Games, it’s time to wake up. Either fire this man or prepare to bury New World for good. This update might very well be the final nail in the coffin.\nFinal Verdict: A flawed masterpiece held hostage by poor leadership.

Hope you’re ready to spend an entire week gathering materials just to sew together some ugly trousers that you’ll never wear because the stats are garbage. And don’t even get me started on all the random stuff you have to craft just to level up your skills—99% of it goes straight into the scrap pile. It’s like they turned a survival game into a full-time job, and the paycheck is disappointment.  \n\nAnd then there’s the endgame content, which feels like Minecraft and Skyrim had a baby, but it inherited all the grind and none of the charm. Sure, there’s stuff to do—side quests, farming, and building—but the loot? Meh. After hours of slogging through endless farming and fighting, you finally get a shiny new item... that’s slightly better than the garbage you were already using. Woohoo.  \n\nThe PvP is fun if you’re into faction wars and smacking strangers with a giant hammer, but it doesn’t do much to distract from the repetitive grind. And the side quests? Let’s just say they involve a lot of killing the same mobs and picking up shiny things like a very violent Easter egg hunt.  \n\nNew World isn’t a *bad* game—it’s just a game that demands an unreasonable amount of your time and rewards you with a shrug. If you love grinding, crafting, and farming until your soul leaves your body, then Aeternum’s got your name on it. But for the rest of us?

Hoje posso afirmar que você não enfrentará fila nenhuma, até porque, quem ainda não parou de jogar é porque realmente gostou do jogo. Estou completando um mês de jogo e jogando todos os dias, e não tenho do que reclamar. \"Ah, mas o jogo tá cheio de bugs\". Me aponte um jogo perfeito, sem bugs. WoW, BDO, entre outros, até hoje têm bugs que estão longe de serem completamente corrigidos. Estarei à sua espera!\n\nÉ o único jogo, depois de MU, que me faz passar horas jogando. Jogo com tudo no \"alto\" e os gráficos ficam surpreendentes. Várias áreas focam na natureza de forma absurdamente linda. O sistema de PvP é super divertido, e o sistema de armas e itens é muito complexo e bem feito (com rumores de melhorar ainda mais). A alta chance é de ser um jogo que dificilmente será abandonado, pois a Amazon vai continuar investindo no game. Porém, é claramente indicado para jogadores que gostam de jogos massivos, de upar serviços, armas, habilidades, entre outros além do nível do personagem.\n\nO jogo é extremamente viciante. A melhor parte é que tudo que você faz ganha experiência de nível e não apenas matando monstros. Cada coisa no mundo tem uma habilidade diferente que vai upando. Dá para comprar casas para ajudar no teleporte, e cada arma que você coloca na mão define a classe que vai usar. Você pode resetar os pontos de habilidade e de atributos quando quiser gratuitamente até certo nível, e depois custa pouco dinheiro ou Azoth. Os servidores foram trancados para novas contas para que os jogadores não enfrentassem filas e fossem distribuídos em todos, e agora já estão liberados novamente. Não recomendo jogar com tudo no máximo, pois aquece demais a placa de vídeo, e se diminuir quase não faz diferença no gráfico. Dá para deixar só a textura alta. Enfim, merece 10 estrelas!\n\nOs servidores já foram normalizados, quanto à questão das filas. O jogo é maravilhoso, imersivo demais ao ponto de você esquecer do restante do mundo, da hora, e te colocar diretamente dentro do jogo literalmente.\n\nGráficos perfeitos!

I personally love this game and have played it sense the beta test, but it may not be for everyone. \n\nNow to address some things, yes the game has micro transactions however they are not pay to win, they are mainly skins and cosmetic items, the only slight boost that you can pay for is to unlock premium rewards during season events, when I say \"slight boost\" I mean you get some better, cooler crafting supplies and extra cosmetics form the premium season event rewards, to note the crafting supplies you get from the premium pass can be obtained by anyone as long as their crafting levels are high enough (it is just extra that you don't need to spend mats to make). As for the lore that really just falls under personal opinion, I personally like it because its unique and interesting due to it including a few cool cultures from history and being set in what i think is the late 1600s, however I can also see a lot of people finding it boring and bland so there is that to consider if your thinking of buying it for the RP. Now for the grinding aspect of this game, I personally think its fine and really quite addicting, I have heard people complain a lot about the amount of time and grinding it takes to reach max levels but looking at it from a gamer perspective what mmorpgs don't take a lot of grinding and time to fully level up crafting skills, I will say tho if grinding is not something you enjoy and it is something you actively despise don't buy this game because there is definitely a lot of it.\n\nThe game itself has plenty to do between main quests, side quests, pvp, faction pvp, dungeons, crafting, exploring, world bosses, special events and mat grinding so it is hard to get bored. One of the things I find nice about the game is you can really decide what you want to do day by day and are not forced to do one thing or the other. As for pvp it can be really fun and interactive, I don't personally play the pvp aspect of the game very much but when I do I really enjoy it. One of the most interesting aspects of the game to me is the faction pvp as it adds game politics which in itself is an interesting thing to watch.\n\nOne last thing to note before buying this game is if you are hoping its a modern WOW you might as well not buy the game, they are both great games but have completely different mechanics, visions, game play and ideas behind them so trying to compare the two is pointless.

I really enjoy this game, but I can't stay can't play if I can't stay logged in.\n\n---Update - February 2025 - Game still has an disconnect issue. The game becomes unplayable for random amounts of time (game won't stay logged in for more than 30 seconds). This seems to become significantly worse after large patches for 3-5 days after the patch. I will update again in March. \n\nMarch here, Go fuck yourself Amazon. I've done everything on Amazons 4 year old list of not getting flagged by the anti-cheat for no reason. Still can't play the game normally. Always disconnecting. I only play this game because I have friends that do. Do yourself a favor and play go play Final Fantasy online if you need a break from WoW. This game sucks.\n\nI'll make a list\n\n-Game disconnects randomly due to anti cheat - No permanent fix currently available\n- The tool tips for items that came out well over a year ago are just incorrect on what they do\n- Amazon has systematically removed all methods of measuring your DPS including target dummies. Why? Now everyone uses the same weapon, the rapier, and even more boring they use the same rapier \"The Finisher\"\n- Total shit interface. In other MMO's you can save a prebuilt spec and gear. This game you need to pay for an item set, but that item set doesn't respec you so you'll need to redo attribute points and weapon builds every single time you want to play a different role on the same weapon.\n- They disabled fall damage because there's no penalty for death. IE instant teleport if you jump off a cliff. When I finish a quest I just let a mob kill me so I can fast travel for free. Just let me fast travel for free then.

Entretanto, a execução parece ter sido feita por um grupo de programadores amadores, sem alguém para gerenciar o projeto de forma adequada. Não estou desmerecendo esses grupos, até porque já tivemos muitos jogos incríveis feitos por estúdios pequenos ou até por uma única pessoa.\nNo caso de New World, é simplesmente descaso da empresa com o consumidor.\n\nO maior problema do jogo é a otimização. Para um jogo com gráficos datados, é um absurdo a falta de cuidado. Quem acha que esses gráficos são de última geração está sendo clubista. O jogo já nasceu com gráficos medianos para a época, nada especial.\n\nMesmo assim, ele é extremamente mal otimizado. Não faz sentido precisar de um computador de 20 mil reais para jogar New World, muito menos para rodar tranquilamente. Um PC de 3 mil reais já deveria ser suficiente para esse jogo!\n\n\nNÃO comprem por esse preço abusivo só porque o jogo foi renomeado para \"New World: Aeternum\".\nNão vale nem um pouco a pena!", "timestamp_created": 1737042336, "timestamp_updated": 1737042336, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514563083648681641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Amazon Games a brillamment réussi à créer un monde ouvert vaste et vivant, où chaque recoin de l’île d’Aeternum déborde de mystères, de dangers et d’opportunités.\n\nGraphiquement, New World est une claque visuelle. Les environnements sont sublimes et variés, passant de forêts denses baignées de lumière à des marais inquiétants et des ruines anciennes mystérieuses. L’attention portée aux détails donne une réelle impression d’immersion. Le cycle jour/nuit et les effets météorologiques dynamiques renforcent cette sensation d’un monde en perpétuelle évolution.\n\nLe gameplay est fluide et dynamique. Le système de combat en temps réel, sans ciblage automatique, donne une véritable sensation de contrôle. Chaque coup porté, chaque esquive et chaque blocage demandent précision et réactivité. Ce choix rend les affrontements bien plus engageants que dans de nombreux MMORPG classiques. La variété des armes et des styles de combat permet à chacun de façonner son propre style de jeu, sans être enfermé dans des classes figées.\n\nL’économie dirigée par les joueurs est un pilier central de New World. La récolte de ressources, l’artisanat et le commerce sont extrêmement bien intégrés, créant un écosystème vivant où chaque métier a son importance. L’évolution des villes grâce aux efforts des joueurs apporte un sentiment de progression collective unique.\n\nLes guerres de territoires entre factions ajoutent une dimension stratégique et compétitive passionnante. Conquérir, défendre et gérer des territoires implique coopération et stratégie, donnant un vrai poids aux actions des guildes. Ce système PvP massivement multijoueur est l’un des plus réussis du genre, offrant des batailles épiques et mémorables.\n\nMême l’exploration pure est gratifiante. L’île regorge de secrets, de donjons et d’événements dynamiques. Chaque sortie dans la nature peut mener à des découvertes inattendues, des combats intenses ou des alliances opportunes.\n\nEn résumé, New World est une réussite qui combine action, stratégie, coopération et exploration dans un univers immersif et somptueux. Amazon Games a su poser les bases solides d’un MMORPG moderne, tout en innovant avec des mécaniques engageantes. Un monde où chaque joueur peut véritablement laisser son empreinte.

It has improved alot of its systems and more. Better performance, better story/dialogue/characters, a lot more to do both pve and PvP wise. Even the terrain is fun to jump and climb on, where it turns into a game of super Mario and parkour. However, It is grindy, and this is a hit or miss for players. But it isn’t like some games where there’s nothing to do at end game…there is plenty to do. It’s one of those games where it’s ok to take it slow, like RuneScape for example. The gear balance is decent for an mmo, unlike some where getting the best gear really puts you leagues above others. To get best in socket gear depends on what you’re trying to do. I’ve managed to get to a respectable gear level despite 95 hours as I write this review, being able to do content and stay on par with players. \n\nThe community is lively and people talk to each other, especially with the feature of VOIP talking in game. hearing someone talk on the mic in town is funny sometimes and adds life to the world, especially when many MMOs suffer from the curse of toxicity or no interactions. The game has alot of sweats but it’s not as bad as some other games. But you also have alot of casuals as well, as the community seems to be a bit more emotionally intelligent…maybe not super happy and rainbows like FFXIV but better than others.  I’ve found the community to be gamers averaging around 30 years old, although there are some younger gamers present as well.\n\nOn one hand, all the systems smoothly integrate into each other. Crafting has many purposes unlike some MMOs where it becomes an afterthought. There’s a good balance of both pve and PvP with an emphasis on PvP. The territory control mechanics are alright compared to some other MMOs I played (throne liberty, mortal online, etc)…while gate keeping is a common problem in these open world PvP type games, it’s implemented here in a way where you don’t have that issue and many servers have a good balance of healthy PvP. PvP is optional if you wanna keep your flag off but there are some areas where it gets turned on…those are end game areas. It’s not punishing too much if you do die, unlike some other PvP loot MMOs that are very unforgiving and you lose all your stuff…because let’s be honest, no one likes their time wasted. I\n\nThe combat is some of the most fun I’ve had in a mmo. I’ve phased out a bit from tab targeting and NW makes combat more engaging due to its real time action rpg elements.  You can turn the game into a dark souls game as a melee player or a fps 3rd person shooter if you have the bow musket or blunderbuss…healing is more fun in this game than other MMOs too. \n\nThere’s so much customization in builds you can do and all the weapons are pretty balanced, although there are some obvious combinations that are very strong…you can make anything work technically depending on if you do pve PvP or both. I’ve spent alot of time theory crafting and it’s honestly one of my favorite parts of the game. You don’t have to min max with the meta builds but it is good to still know what they are so you don’t get too weird with your build and you’re wondering why it doesn’t work in some areas of content. I would recommend finding a guild or friends and running content that way so you don’t fall into pugging with randoms and being succumbed to the usual link gear, gatekeeping aspects. Choose your play style.\n\nGetting to max level doesn’t take too long (less than a week if you’re fast). But even the leveling isn’t a bad experience, as exploring the world, climbing mountains and finding all kinds of things is quite interesting.\n\nThe story and voice acting is pretty good. It’s your typical mmo lore but it does have its own flavor and uniqueness being in a 1700s fantasy theme, which is unique.\n\nIf you have a good pc system, the graphics are breathtaking.  It looks pretty good on console too. \n\nThere’s also a roadmap now so the game is doing pretty well. AGS managed to turn the game around with releasing it to console and fixing many systems.\n\nThere’s a cash shop and some ways to speed up certain processes but definitely not pay to win, although it can get expensive for skins. The game has good default skins so you don’t necessarily have to use the cash shop. AGS has to support the game somehow, right? You can do everything free if you wanted although the season pass is nice with exclusive skins, bonuses and materials to make life easier and faster. \n\nI can go on and more but wanted to highlight some of the more talked about points to dispel some confusion. Despite some of the reviews, it’s a great game but definitely not for everyone. Would I recommend it to a person who has a wife and kids and can only play an hour a day? It would probably take you awhile to progress and there are better games for casual play. Do you have 2-3 hours a day to spare a day or even a couple days a week? You can make it work. You still geta good amount of gameplay out of it if you don’t burn yourself out trying to get to max level fast….which for some reason, people feel inclined to move fast. I moved a bit fast myself but I still paid attention to the story and mingled with the community. Just live in the moment and enjoy it.

I have put in just over 100 hours since buying this game about a week ago and I have been enjoying it, for the most part... It's easy to say that for everything I like about the game, there is something about it that I dont like. If you haunt played it you have to go into the game knowing that just about any game that has a PVP focus is going to come with a majority of immaturity. In my 100 hours I have met three people who didnt put out vibes of a teenager trying to seem cool in a room full of adults. There is also NO name restrictions for guilds or characters, so there are a lot of... creative.. Names. The chat system is a cluster, causing people to not know if they're getting a direct message and a lot of the community have the different chats off because of the trying-to-be-cool-teens. However if you do meet someone, make a friend and quest together or take down a giant boss, dungeon or PVP together, like any mmo, always makes the game better.\n\nThe war system is a cool, but complicated system, unlike games like conquerors blade where people can just up and take it with numbers.. this game provides lots of stages and gives both sides preparation before one side can overtake the other. It's a steep learning curve, but getting into a Company (Games Guild System) can help with that.\n\nOn the topic of companies, I got pulled into one recently and they do not like new people, most people I've interacted with dont.. There are lots of tutorials and websites on the internet to answer questions and I suggest you find them because if you ask a question in this game, you will get laughed at... teens..\n\nBut with all its downsides brought on by a not-so-friendly community, If you have friends to play the game with it is a good game.. The structured PVE is fun but doesn't hold you hand like some MMOs, PVP is unforgiving, causing you to focus because one bad move can turn the tide and ruin the match for your team. The questing is hard, but fun.. Picking a class you like and learning to survive with it is great, however, with a no class system you can always switch.\n\nOverall, I wish the community was a little more new friendly, but I, like many others, turn my chat off and enjoy the times when the teens are in school and the game is fun.\n\n---{ Graphics }--- Character models are mid, but the scenery looks good.\n☐ Beautiful\n☑ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n\n---{ Gameplay }--- I have tried almost all classes and like them all, combat is fun and difficult.\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☐ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☐ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☐ Grandma\n\n\n---{ PC Requirements }--- Had Zero Frame drops on the highest settings.

Cross-play is HUGE for an MMO and I love that they did that. While it didn't launch with the most amazing range of content, it still had a major strength in it's game-play and design by allowing players to experience every part of the game on a single character (Weapons, armor, professions, etc. which rewards your time as a player). I was still able to find creative ways to enjoy the game. For example, I would get together with some buddies, we would invite everyone we could on the server to the middle of a town, and DJ lengthy inner town shows where everyone would be naked and use the fire-staff to shoot flamethrowers everywhere.\n\n I did my best to keep my love for this game, but it currently can't quite find it's own identity and suffers from trying to copy other Live service methods that are not widely enjoyed or healthy to the game, but more so healthy to keep money into the pockets of the people running the game. Which I wouldn't mind, people need to be paid and servers need to be ran. However, it becomes a sad sight when the primary highlights of content releases for this game take the form of refurbishing old areas and quests, a seasonal pass model that expires even when you have paid for it, and a lengthy list of other smaller issues that add up to discourage enjoyment. The map is a good example, as there appears to be such a MASSIVE amount of map space that is not available yet, and has not been available or given to players except in the form of on expanded region and an already existing zone, refurbished to house the PAID DLC Rise of the Angry Earth. A large list of unreleased weapons being slowly drip fed to players over a ridiculously long time, is also another notable issue.\n\nI'm ONLY giving this game a thumbs up because I had great times in the world of Aeternum, with so many good people, doing all kinds of fun stuff with what was given to us at the time. That being said, with nothing but love and respect to the AGS team, I cannot find any reason to continue spending my time in this game any longer. If there ends up being a huge positive shift in the games direction and expansion, I'll gladly be open minded to the growth and coming back to experience it. I'm rooting for both the game and for AGS.\n\nThank you guys for everything, I now lay this game to rest.", "timestamp_created": 1736641743, "timestamp_updated": 1743749546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534632027149200439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

There's no ammo for weapons anymore, lock on for ranged, andit gets easy to overlevel resulting in a kind of aimless 'I'm already more powerful than everything around me, can we please get to the big bad already and kill it.'\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm just burnt out on the MMO genre, but the most fun thing was crafting, and I can think of a couple games that do that better too.\r\n\r\nVisually impressive, the tone is a Fortnite put on its grown up face, but didn't actually get any older.\r\nAudio is good, with cracks from pickaxes and muskets having properly loud and impactful reverb and depth.\r\nStructurally, the game seems like it went into a blender with a bunch of 'this is what MMOs have, right?' and came out the other end.\r\n\r\nIts a mediocre game that may possibly be a great game for someone who finds a good community or really dives into the PVP on the extreme competative end. The rest is just kind of window dressing that looks nice, but has clearly very talented and enthusiastic people behind it accompanied by just as many 'phone it in, this won't be a Game of the Year' people.\r\n\r\nIt could have been what I'd hoped to get out of Elder Scrolls Online, instead it does the combat one better, and then feels about as hollow as ESO everywhere else.

The concept is truly genius, offering a visually stunning world and a sandbox experience that could have been a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the execution by Amazon Game Studios is nothing short of disappointing.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first release, New World has been plagued by bugs, many of which remain unfixed to this day. For example, in the Outpost Rush mode, you still cannot see who killed you—an issue that has been pointed out repeatedly by the community but ignored by the developers. Comfort features are also glaringly absent. Simple quality-of-life improvements, such as the ability to sort items in your inventory or storage by name, are still missing, making inventory management a frustrating chore.\r\n\r\nThe lack of attention to such basic details is baffling, especially for a studio with the resources of Amazon. While the core gameplay and concept are undeniably captivating, the persistent bugs and missing features make it hard to stay engaged. It feels like the game was rushed to market and then abandoned, leaving players to deal with half-baked mechanics and unresolved issues.\r\n\r\nIf Amazon Game Studios could invest more time and effort into fixing the numerous issues and listening to player feedback, New World could become the MMO it was meant to be. As it stands now, however, the game is a frustrating mix of brilliance and incompetence.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\r\nGreat concept, poor execution.

It isn't. I'm going to get to max level (65) and then drop it like it's hot. This plays like every other MMO out there with the minor exception of muskets. I queued for the 3v3 PvP Arena and after 48 minutes, I just completed some quests and then exited the game. The story isn't particularly interesting. The main story quests are \"go here and kill this boss\" or \"go there and collect these items\". Honestly, there are probably Free-to-Play games that are better than this. 5/10. Overall, this is mid.\n\nUPDATED: \nI paid roughly $40 for this game and it just wasn't worth it. This game offers about 10% of what Elder Scrolls Online does and you can pick that up for 5-10 bucks these days. There is no endgame in New World. No prestige system. No champion system. No reason to stick around. Attempting to queue for group events is a waste of time because of the low player count. This game is already past its Amazon Prime and Amazon needs to convert this to free-to-play or its going to crash and burn. I played 600+ hours of Elder Scrolls Online and... yep, I'm going back. There's nothing of substance here. PvP looks like \"shoot musket, roll and dodge, repeat\" except for the smoothbrains that brought big swords into a gun game. Might as well play COD then. I would recommend this game if you get to play it for free, but honestly, I have absolutely no idea how people are putting more than 50 hours into this without getting completely bored because the zones aren't even level-scaled. If you miss a zone (and by the construct of the story, you will), do you really want to go and do a level 40 zone at level 60? Wtf? Nope. We're done here. \n\nThis is overrated dogshit. Barely three years old and this game is already dying, and that's in spite of the \"refresh\". That's terrible for an MMO. Elder Scrolls Online, despite being a 10 year old game, has more concurrent players than this shit. More people still play WOW and OSRS. Yeah... this game never deserved the hype.

No hay build que sea destructora en solitario, no te podes solear bichos fuertes, ni dungeons con poca gente siendo \"ultra op\", por lo que sumado a lo que dije anteriormente, tener 200hs+ para conseguir todo un set crafteado por vos, no te sirve de nada porque todavia asi, no vas a poder solearte nada importante.\n\nComunidad: 5/10\n\nEl juego en PvE está muerto, o si no agonizando.\nLlegas a querer pedir gente para hacer una Dungeon y vas a tardar 20m+ en encontrar, si queres mandar una dungeon específica vas a estar +40m a +2hs, por lo que jugar solo no es una opción. \nSe tarda eso porque ya el 98% de las dungeon que existen están obsoletas y no sirven ni dropean nada bueno, solo las dos ultimas de dlc, por lo que la gente abandono completamente estas actividades (que son las mejores como dije mas arriba)\n\nJuego en equipo: 9/10\n\nTenes rol de daño, de tanque, y de healer. Cada uno debe cumplir su rol en una dungeon, hacen lo tipico de estos roles, no hace falta explicar. Si tenes un grupo o amigos este juego lo disfrutas un montón, siempre y cuando no vayas al pvp donde hay gorditos con +2000hs y equipamiento fulleado para pvp.\n\nPVP: 5/10\n\nRancio. Se puede spamear un esquive cada 1.5s, y lo roto es todo lo que pegue a distancia. No hay variedad en roles de pvp mas que lo que está en meta. Si sos un hijo de mil puta que le gusta jugar armas melee te vas a cagar de aburrimiento jugando guerras o 3v3, vas a necesitar siempre un compañero que pegue a rango ya que si alcanzas a un mago/arquero te empieza a dar saltitos cada 1.5s, te ralentiza y stunean y te moriste. No hay variedad de pvp mas que lo que dicta el juego, como ya dije por la falta de perks/opciones en la armadura/defensa.\n\nen conclusion, es un juego que disfrutas mucho con +3 amigos, sino no lo vale.

I bought the game once when it launched, paid for the expansion when that came out, and didn't have to pay a dime to continue paying for the relaunch. So those comments are just fake news.\n\nSecondly, you have to take negative reviews on MMORPGs with a grain of salt. There are people who legit get more enjoyment writing bad reviews that offer nothing in the way of constructive criticism than they do from actually playing the games. It reminds me of WoW players who talk all day on their forums about how much they hate the game, yet haven't played anything else for 20 years. With this game, people made their impressions based off its launch (which had problems) and refuse to change their opinion from their, despite all of the progress it's made.\n\nBottom line, this is a good game. The action combat is fun, the graphics are great, and it has a lot of good systems. It's got a solid player base that's only expanded after cross-platforming with consoles, it's a B2P model with ZERO pay to win features, no subscription, and a lot of great content for both PVE and PVP players. Is it perfect? No. But you shouldn't be swayed away from trying the game because of negative review bots who aren't saying anything in good faith anyway. You can easily sink 1k hours into this game and have a good time and that would be worth the box price alone. In terms of PVP it might be one of the best skill-based MMORPGs out there, and I don't think people have really caught on to that fact yet. \n\nThe game is in the best spot it's been in for a while.

You fight your way to survival on a burning ship against what looks like demonic zombies and wake up on a mysterious island, in which you are quite literally thrust right into the thick of a story that I...am honestly not even quite sure about. lol \n\nThe strengths of New World is what keeps me coming back, at least for now. \n\n[b]⫷ Graphics ⫸[/b]\n\nThe assets are very well made, especially foliage and trees and general buildings, and is further enhanced by truly beautiful colors. Everything is vivid and stands out (perhaps, to an extent, to a fault concerning UI), and I truly enjoy just looking at how beautiful the world of Aeternum is. I actually enjoy walking through the woods or sitting atop a mountain top and moving the camera around to catch different angles. \n\n[b]⫷ UI / Interface ⫸[/b] \n\nOne of it's major problems is UI. The overall designs are very good. The inventory categories could stand out a bit more with actual dividers instead of \"Rewards, Tools\" etc etc, but overall, their design choices are fine. The issue is that they seemed to have just stopped at \"Yo, we need a good pause menu and inventory\". So, basically, there's a general lack of and a few bugs/issues.\n\nWhere is the group UI customization options? Why can't I pin members of my group to my compass? Why can't I assign them colors? And why isn't there a minimap? You have to pause and open your map any time you want to track your group or anything at all. \n\n[b]⫷ Sound Effects / Music ⫸[/b] \n\nIt's very good. The sound effects at least are incredible. I really love the sound of mining and chopping trees, and love that I can hear others logging or mining if I'm close enough. The sharp TACK it makes at contact is extremely satisfying. The sound of the guns or the animals or the wind etc etc is very good. \n\nThe music is really good, but nothing to write home about. \n\n[b]⫷ Controls / Controller Support ⫸[/b] \n\nI initially played it with keyboard and mouse. I hated it. I really do not know how people are playing the other way, except maybe because for some reason when you play on controller, it super zooms you in. The controller support makes the game feel even more like it's just an RPG game your friends can jump into, because it feels like it was designed with controllers from the start.\n\n[b]⫷ Character Creator ⫸[/b] \n\nIt's honestly one of the worst out there. You have such a limited range of options. On top of that, all color options are extremely limited too. And even worse, guess what? There's no way to change your appearance later on, not even your hair. Another token into the basket of \"Doesn't feel like an MMO to me\". \n\nThey need to revamp this shit and fast. The people I got into the game nearly quit right there. More options would help out immediately, and the ability to change appearances.\n\n[b]⫷ Combat ⫸[/b] \n\nIt's not a TAB semi-stationary target MMO. It's a strange combination of Diablo IV and Lost Ark, I would say. On keyboard, you move with WASD. Q, R, and F are your abilities. The 1 and 2 keys is to swap weapons but strangely the tilda key (~) is \"put weapon away\" and guess what? You go slower if your weapon is out, and somehow the best option to put your weapon away was ~ key. lol TAB is your inventory. ESC is your pause/bigger menus. Right click = guard and left click is \"attack\". Don't bother with guarding, it's practically useless. Oh, and space bar is jump.  \n\nYou engage combatants as you would in a more action orientated game. You run up to them and can move around and use items and what have you as you fight. Again, a lot like Diablo IV or Lost Ark--or if you played it, very similar to Throne and Liberty.\n\nIt's okay. Nothing terrible, nothing spectacular.\n\n(combat feels much better with a controller)\n\n[b]⫷ Enemy A.I ⫸[/b] \n\nIt's bad. \n\nThe enemies are like rocks that can swing at you sometimes. And frustratingly enough, most of them have absurd speed, so they attack relentlessly. Which isn't hard, just fucking annoying. lol\n\n[b]⫷ The World ⫸[/b] \n\nThe world is beautiful as I said above, but it's extremely small in the grand scheme of things. Another reason it doesn't feel like an MMO at all. I think what would greatly help New World, is to focus future expansions on new lands. They might have written themselves into a corner with the whole \"island\" plot but whose to say they can't have our heroes expand their horizons? Maybe they can fall into the Bermuda Triangle next and arrive at Hollow Earth to fight King Kong. lmao either way, expand zones dramatically, or you will 100% see the death of this game.\n\n[b]⫷ Story / Lore ⫸[/b] \n\nI honestly have no idea if there's a real story going on here but hey, you can collect lore books!\n\n[b]⫷ Crafting / Gathering ⫸[/b] \n\nOf all the MMOs I have played, it definitely feels like \"the best\". Now, I do think classic World of Warcraft and FFXIV generally have a better crafting environment (in what you can do with it), New World's gathering/crafting is truly a lot of fun. Maybe not fun to fight over nodes, but still so good that I genuinely believe it is the game's strongest aspect. The crafting is also very engaging, and usually requires other gathering professions involved to create things of importance.\n\nIt's my favorite part of the game easily. I would say the only way to improve, is to give us more to do with crafting/gathering itself. \n\n[b]⫷ Conclusions ⫸[/b] \n\nI haven't touched PVP or the town management yet, doesn't interest me, but Steam is complaining I can't write anymore, so yeah. \n\nOverall, a very enjoyable game, but definitely doesn't feel like an MMO to me at all. I'm not sure how long I will play, but I imagine once I beat it, I'll dip, because the world is just way too small to sustain these numbers or interest for long. Give up on those stupid ass seasons and give us ACTUAL expansions.\n\nGet it on a sale if you wanna try it out. \n\n4/5", "timestamp_created": 1735898273, "timestamp_updated": 1735898464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

С увеличением количества прожитых лет, хардкорно гриндить я все меньше и меньше готов, поэтому хочется более сессионного развлечения, но с ММОшной прокачкой, мили боевкой и разными активностями, для чего NW мне сейчас подходит\r\n\r\nЛичные плюсы и минусы NW:\r\nПлюсы:\r\n- Приятная нон таргет боевка как в ПВП так и в ПВЕ\r\nТакже можно чилово играть с дуалсенса (а можно и не чилово, рейд горгоны закрывал с геймпада. На геймпаде значительную разницу от клавомыши заметил только в ПВП на ренж пушках. На мили билдах разницы не увидел)\r\n- Билдостроение\r\nМожно экспериментировать с различными билдами и комбинациями пушек, а не \"как обычно\" в иных ММО: 1-2 оружия на персонажа, а хочешь новый геймлей - качайся заново миллион часов. Да, есть мета, но она не мешает развлекаться и пробовать новое\r\n- Мало времени нужно для капа\r\nЗа 274ч имею полтора кап персонажа: 1 с полностью финальными шмотками и 2й на половине. Для меня, как человека с работой и личной жизнью, который хочет вечерком сходить побить босса или порубиться в пвп с таким же гиром соперниками (а не как во многих ММО: качайся пол года по 10 часов в день, или задонать квартиру)\r\n- Приятная графика и геймплей \r\nНе рвется глаз от старых механик и текстур, тк всё в этом плане современно и часто похоже на сингловую игру\r\n- Нет pay to win - донат магазин в основном из скинчиков+сезонный пропуск\r\n\r\nМинусы:\r\n- Встречаются баги \r\nЧаще всего минорные графические или звуковые - то есть закрывать игру ради них не надо, но открыть лишний раз меню/инвентарь, или повторить действие бывает приходится\r\n- Мало хай левел контента\r\nЧто дает ценность: раз в неделю ходишь в рейд горгоны. Остальные активности делаются в произвольном порядке (или не делаются). Мутации, честраны, ПВП трек и прочее. Вроде слышал, что хотят облегчить М3 и сделать, чтобы оттуда падали 725 шмотки - думаю это разнообразит развитие персонажей (кажется, 725 станет текущим 700) \r\n- Малое разнообразие ПВП контента\r\nТут пункт именно про разнообразие, а не про количество. При желании можно ПВПшиться нон стопом сколько хочешь пока не надоест (в отличие от многих ММО, когда ПВП привязано к датам/времени/событиям). Но самих активностей не много. Насколько я слышал из новостей, уже через пару недель добавят новую карту для ОПР, и это хороший вектор развития. Но до тех же БГ из ВоВ пока далековато\r\n\r\nРезюмируя:\r\nЕсли вы не хардкорный гриндер, который по 8 часов в день стоит на спотах в БДО, но любите жанр ММОРПГ и хотите иногда чилово залипнуть в компухтерную игрульку на пару часов, то можно рассмотреть NW. Но при этом если захочется челленжа, то его можно найти (для меня это были: первый раз пройти рейд горгоны, первые проходки мутаций М2+, осваивание ПВП)", "timestamp_created": 1735811014, "timestamp_updated": 1735811014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580448150634765625", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

E o motivo é simples: o jogo NÃO VALE O PREÇO COBRADO.\nComprei o jogo por R$ 327,89 e esperava uma experiência divertida para jogar com meus amigos. No entanto, logo percebi que essa “diversão” não estava nem perto de ser o que eu esperava. Aqui estão os principais motivos para a minha insatisfação:\n\n 1. Preço x Valor:\nNew World: Aetherum simplesmente não vale o que cobram por ele. R$327,89 é um preço exagerado para a quantidade de conteúdo e a experiência que o jogo oferece. Eu diria que o jogo só vale a pena se custar no máximo R$75,00, e mesmo assim, com muitas ressalvas.\n\n2. Problemas com as Quests:\nUm dos maiores problemas do jogo é que as quests não são compartilhadas. Ou seja, se seus amigos estão mais avançados que você e você quer jogar com eles, não vai rolar. Você fica preso a fazer quests solo, enquanto seus amigos já estão em um estágio muito mais à frente. As missões que realmente permitem jogar junto, são todas muito mais pra frente no jogo e, para piorar, são dungeons extremamente chatas. A MER%4 É QUE COMPREI PRA JOGAR COM ELES… POUCO JOGUEI… :(\n\n3. Falta de Progressão Junto aos Amigos:\nComo o jogo não compartilha as quests, jogar com amigos que estão em níveis diferentes torna a experiência frustrante. Se seus amigos avançam muito rápido e você fica para trás, você basicamente vai ter que JOGAR SOZINHO até alcançar o nível deles (lembre-se do ponto número 2 acima, ou seja – não vai rolar) — ou se contentar com missões repetitivas e cansativas, enquanto aguarda para fazer conteúdo de grupo (que nunca fiz). Isso mata a ideia de uma experiência cooperativa e torna o jogo ainda mais monótono.\n\n4. Dungeons Monótonas e Sem Diversão:\nAs dungeons, que são o conteúdo principal para quem quer jogar em grupo, são um verdadeiro saco. Elas são longas, repetitivas e não trazem nenhuma sensação de progresso ou recompensa real. Isso se torna um grande desânimo, especialmente porque essas são as únicas missões em grupo relevantes, e o jogo não oferece mais opções legais de cooperação.\n\n5. E O PIOR DE TUDO: TER QUE FICAR ANDANDO PRA LÁ E PRA CÁ… CHAAAAAAAAAAATOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Como estava com presa de chegar no nível dos meus amigos acabei perdendo toda a LORE do jogo… O que deixou o jogo PIOR AINDA… \n\nConclusão:\nNew World: Aetherum falha em muitos pontos importantes, principalmente na questão de progressão compartilhada e na qualidade das missões em grupo. A jogabilidade cooperativa, que deveria ser o ponto forte do jogo, acaba sendo um grande bloqueio, deixando os jogadores frustrados e desmotivados. Se você está pensando em gastar R$ 327,89 para jogar com amigos, sugiro procurar outra opção (ONCE HUMAN – TEM O DOBRO DE PLAYERS QUE esse jogo de @#$@#$@). Para mim, esse jogo não vale nem perto do que cobram por ele.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1735772455, "timestamp_updated": 1735772455, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50641024112701416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Entwickelt von Amazon Games, entführt es die Spieler auf die mystische Insel Aeternum, wo Abenteuer, Geheimnisse und Gefahren an jeder Ecke lauern.\r\n\r\nWas sofort ins Auge sticht, ist die Grafik. Die Landschaften sind atemberaubend: dichte Wälder, schneebedeckte Berge, gruselige Sumpfgebiete und charmante Dörfer – alles ist mit einer Liebe zum Detail gestaltet, die die Welt lebendig wirken lässt. Dazu kommt ein dynamisches Wettersystem, das die Immersion noch verstärkt.\r\n\r\nDas Kampfsystem ist ein echtes Highlight. Es ist actionbasiert und erfordert taktisches Denken sowie präzise Steuerung. Spieler können zwischen verschiedenen Waffen und Fähigkeiten wechseln, was eine Vielzahl an Spielstilen ermöglicht. Ob mit Schwert und Schild, Magie oder einem Bogen – jede Wahl fühlt sich einzigartig und befriedigend an.\r\n\r\nDie Gemeinschaft spielt in New World eine große Rolle. Die Fraktionssysteme und Kriege sorgen für spannende PvP-Momente, während PvE-Spieler in Expeditionen und Weltbosskämpfen auf ihre Kosten kommen. Besonders die Möglichkeit, Siedlungen zu übernehmen und auszubauen, schafft ein einzigartiges Gefühl der Zugehörigkeit.\r\n\r\nAuch das Crafting-System verdient Lob. Es ist umfangreich und belohnt Spieler, die Zeit und Mühe investieren, mit hochwertigen Ausrüstungsgegenständen. Die Sammelberufe wie Holzfällerei, Bergbau oder Angeln fügen sich nahtlos ins Spiel ein und bieten eine entspannende Abwechslung zu den actionreichen Kämpfen.\r\n\r\nNatürlich hat New World seine kleinen Schwächen, etwa gelegentliche Balance-Probleme oder repetitive Quests, aber diese werden durch regelmäßige Updates und die aktive Community stetig verbessert.\r\n\r\nInsgesamt ist New World ein großartiges MMORPG, das durch seine wunderschöne Welt, das dynamische Kampfsystem und den Fokus auf Zusammenarbeit und Konflikte besticht. Für alle Fans von Online-Rollenspielen ist es definitiv einen Blick wert!\r\n\r\nWertung: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1735559387, "timestamp_updated": 1735559387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Like many, I can’t pour endless hours into gaming anymore; I typically manage around 10–12 hours a week, mostly on weekends. I grew up playing MMORPGs - with fond memories of World of Warcraft - but it’s been about 12 years since I last ventured into any online world. And let me tell you: New World feels like coming home!\n\nFrom the moment I stepped foot in Aeternum, I felt a rush of nostalgia. It’s hard not to be impressed by the breathtaking graphics (especially on my 4070ti) and the combat mechanics that stand out from other MMOs I’ve played. Battles feel dynamic and fresh = there’s a great mix of dodging, blocking, and timing your strikes. The crafting system is incredibly rewarding; gathering materials, refining them, and crafting your own gear is satisfying and gives you a real sense of progression.\n\nOne thing that really defines my New World experience is the friendly community. Despite my limited playtime, I’ve already encountered wonderful players. From teaming up on quests to just hanging out in town, the social aspect of New World is a blast. A highlight for me was trying out the in-game music system with a group of strangers-turned-friends. Sure, we messed up a lot of notes at first, but it was all in good fun and brought back those carefree, joyful memories of my teenage gaming years.\n\nI can’t speak much on the end-game content because I haven’t reached it yet, but I’ve heard plenty from higher-level players who are busy crafting, upgrading their gear, running PvP quests, and scouring the world for better chests. They seem to have their hands full, which is a promising sign of depth and longevity for those who want a long-term MMO experience.\n\nSure, the game isn’t perfect - but no game is. If we sit around looking for negatives, we’ll certainly find them. However, I entered New World with an open mind, especially after the recent updates, and I believe it deserves that fair chance. The positives here absolutely outweigh any negatives by a wide margin, and for me, it’s been a revitalising journey that brings back the best parts of MMO gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1735397231, "timestamp_updated": 1735397231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

WELL let me tell you this this game is 100% worth it. I am literally investing hours on hours into it so far and I just bought the game 2 days ago lol. The game is absolutely HUGE like I mean so big that it will take almost 1000 hours to complete what they have so far released into the game and that not including whats to come. Amazon games did a great job the story is great the graphics are good the combat is really good close to a souls like combat. The leveling up is insanely big and extensive. I am level 28 right now and I barley have hit the tip of the iceberg. There is so many different ways to build your player that and the amount of players on the game right now is huge so there are lots of friendly supportive people that can make you feel welcomed in the game.

As a long time gamer, here's my review based on playbility. \n\n I've tried each incarnation and it feels like they've finally hit a note that works for both the casuals and the intense. I can play both and have my favorite way to play. I run with a large group of friends and we vary in styles and intensity. New world has finally found a balance for us all so everyone is having a great time, it's easy to play together, and chat while we're all doing our own thing. Will your intense player friends play forever? no. But they'll play for a solid few months and come back regularly for a weekend or three while you casuals can continue tinkering on at your own pace, collecting everything, doing everything, maxing everything when you have the time. THe point is, unlike many MMO's I've played, this one is nice to come back to and now that they've streamlined the basic required MSQ, it's easy to even start from nothing and enjoy the rebuild or save your end game character and pop in to play with your casual friends for some gorgeous dungeons. \n\nFor me, I ignore the people that bitch about the cost. here's how it went. New world launched at full price. when years later it added new areas and mounts along with some other things, they lowered the price of New World to half and charged the same price for the new DLC with new land and mounts etc. it was a fair price given all the years New World had been out. Now it's combined the original and DLC to make one game and completely changed a lot of the game in massive ways so it's full price for both. It all makes sense and people who complain apparently think the world works for years on games for free.  Don't want to pay? By it on sale. \n\nLast thing I'll add. This game is colorful and bright without being overly cartoony. The weapons and mounts are ridiculously oversized so it's got an air of playfulness about it. It's a refreshing break from the dark dreary landscapes, settings and storylines of depressing impossibleness or anime styles of recent years. All in all. get some mates or find some in game. Most of the player base is now respectful at least if now just down right friendly and helpful. My review bottom line... It's worth it. If you don't bring friends with you, you'll make friendly acquaintances which come in handy in places where another person is helpful or sometimes required. The game does a good job at watching server populations and merging when necessary to keep enough people around to lend a hand and the end game ongoing raids, races, wars, dungeons, incoming assaults from npc's etc, keep the end game fresh because it's always a different group of people you're working with to succeed. \n\nMost importantly, I continue to see this game expanding and being worked on. Future things are coming and that's nice to look forward to and hang on for.

So you can really try out different builds and weapons and see what works for you.\n- Leveling your skills has a real purpose behind it and it's not a terrible grindfest to go through\n- I've always been a PVE player, never engaged with PVP in games. But in Aeternum the PVP stuff it's actually a lot of fun.\n- Music is quite nice also and the sounds effects are great\n\n[b]Dislike:[/b]\n- NPC models aren't the most pretty. But honestly it doesn't bother me because the voice acting is good\n- The in-game shop is way too expensive for the cosmetics\n- The player driven economy is a hit and miss. I get the idea, but I would really like if there was also a NPC store where you could sell stuff.\n- There are some wonky elements in the game but nothing game breaking\n- There are no mounts of cosmetics you can unlock via expeditions etc\n\nOverall I didn't expect to like the game as much as I'm currently doing. There are flaws in the game, but I can overlook that for the sheer fun factor I'm getting out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1735208798, "timestamp_updated": 1735208798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Le gameplay est bon, la progression est fluide et agreable avec une bonne évolution et gestion de la difficulté.\nLe systeme de métier est riche et beaucoup moins ennuyeux que sur d'autres mmo.\nLe housing est poussé.\n\nPoints négatifs :\nCependant le contenu PvP (chose pour laquelle j'ai acheté le jeu) est tres tres mauvais. \nSur le contenu en lui meme : Il y a que deux modes, 20c20 ou 3c3.\n\nLe mode 20c20 ressemble a un bordel sans nom, des barres de vie partout qui rendent les combats difficilement lisibles et surtout un équilibrage a la ramasse. Si vous etes un meta slave n'ayez crainte, il vous suffira de choisir la bonne arme et de rouler votre tete sur votre clavier pour venir a bout de vos adversaires les plus talenteux. Pour les autres, bonne chance.\n\nLe TTK est completement différent d'une arme a l'autre, 3 à 5 coups de haches ou d'épee suffisent a tuer un distance, alors qu'un archer auras besoin de mettre au moins 10 à 15 fleches pour esperer tuer un joueur corps a corps à stuff équivalent (s'il n'est pas heal). Mais de toutes facons, arrivé au stade ou vous l'aurez presque tué, ce noble joueur partira simplement en courant en zig zag et vous ne le reverrez jamais. La montagne de fun :D\n\nIl y a aussi des tanks ... litteralement intuables, comptez 2-3 bonnes minutes en 6v1 pour esperer pouvoir le deloger du point de capture, voir plus s'il exploite corretement la mécanique du bouclier et de la recharge de vitalié et s'il n'est pas heal ... Si jamais un heal arrive au moment ou vous etiez sur le point de le tuer c'est reparti pour 5 minutes, car la ou vous avez passé une éternité à lui enlever sa vie, il ne faut qu'une ou deux secondes au healer pour le remettre en plein forme, la montagne de fun :D \n\nSi vous avez été attiré par le gameplay au premier abord, je vous suggere de ne pas vous fier aux apparences, car les nombreux effets de controle rendront vos esquive parfaitement innéfficaces voir impossibles. La montagne de fun :D\nEt tout ceci couronné d'un match making inexistant qui donne des partie si déséquilibrées en terme de composition qu'une des deux equipes au moins une fois sur 5 ne peut meme pas sortir du spawn. \n\nEnsuite la 3v3. Pour le coup le mode arène est bien mais il vous faudra passer 5 minutes en file d'attente pour un match qui en dure a peine 2 .. rien de plus a ajouter. \n\nEt pour finir l'open pvp. N'esperez pas pouvoir y prrendre part avant au moins 150 à 200h de jeu tant l'écart entre un joueur stuff ou non est immense. Vous ne pourrez y participer qu'apres avoir farmer vos items best in slot. MAIS, si comme moi vous avez innoncement fait le choix d'un build qui avait l'air de vous plaire sans vous soucier de la meta, c'est reparti pour des dixaines d'heures de farm :D. \nCar en effet, certaines classes sont tellement inutiles que les guildes ne prennent tout simplement pas ces classes dans les groupes pour participer aux guerres du monde ouvert.. \n\nEt cerise sur le gateaux, les grosse guildes des serveurs s'organisent en mafia en s'arrangeant pour se distribuer et conserver les territoires afin de conserver les benefices qu'elles en tirent. Ce qui donne des guerres d'influences quasiment désertes. \n\nEn résumé, je peux le conseiller pour des joueurs PvE occasionnels, les fan de housing et les gens qui aiment les metiers dans les mmo. \n\nPour les autres il n'en vaut a mon sens pas la peine. Il n'y a qu'un seul raid vraiment exigeant à 20 joueurs. \nEt pour les joueurs PvP qui cherchent un jeu pour s'amuser à travers la maitrise des mécaniques il n'y a ce stade aucun interet. \n\nLe jeu a quand meme du potentiel donc a voir dans un an.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1734924813, "timestamp_updated": 1736509511, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}
